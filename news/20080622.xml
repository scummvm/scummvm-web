		You know there's something wrong when Count Drascula stops watching TV and starts conspiring
		with his faithful sidekick, Igor, to take over the world. And he wants to do that before
		tonight's football match starts! You are John Hacker and your mission, should you choose to
		accept it, is to rescue your girlfriend Billy Jean from Count Drascula's nefarious clutches
		and thwart his plans of world domination!
