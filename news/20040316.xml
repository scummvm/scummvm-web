The ScummVM project is pleased to announce the immediate release of ScummVM
0.6.0. ScummVM is a graphic adventure game interpreter designed to allow users
to play many classic adventure game titles on various computer systems;
(Linux, Windows 2000/XP, *BSD, Mac OS X, PocketPC/Handheld PC, Palm,
Dreamcast and more)
</P>
<P>
Version 0.6.0 brings with it a new milestone in ScummVM history, with all
LucasArts/LucasFilm SCUMM adventure titles now being supported. We are also
proud to announce in conjunction with ScummVM 0.6.0 the release of the
classic adventure game 'Flight of the Amazon Queen' (originally available
for the Amiga and DOS) as freeware. The ScummVM team would like to thank
the authors Steve Stamatiadis and John Passfield for providing the team
with the source code to this classic game, and allowing us to release it.

So, what's new?

ScummVM 0.6.0 includes, as usual, many bugfixes in all supported game engines.
There have also been dramatic fixes and improvements in the area of sound and
music, as well as a greatly improved game management/options screen and two new
graphics modes (HQ2x and HQ3x). Most importantly, we have also added new
support for the following games:
