The blazingly fast addition of [*Goblins 3*](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Goblins_3) was gracefully performed thanks to the not-so-big differences from *Gobliins 2*.

For you, an average peasa... adventurer, that means that **YOU** can reach an agreement between King Bodd and Queen Xina.

Will you succeed? Find out by grabbing your old copy of *Goblins 3* from your dusty shelves, combining it with a shiny new [ScummVM 0.10.0svn](/downloads/#daily) (check the build date, it has to be after April 21, 2007, yes, 2007).
