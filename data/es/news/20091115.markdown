It was just 3.5 months ago when we started to prepare for this release, and now finally the day has come.

Ladies and gentlemen, please greet the one and only ScummVM 1.0.0 "Shiny Logo!" The long awaited, the most anticipated, the best... whatever.

We worked very hard on stability in this release, and in addition to all that goodness available since our 1.0.0rc1, we added a new set of ports for Motorola Linux-based phones (those on MotoEZX and MotoMAGX platforms) and fixed just a few hundred bugs.

The release is available from the [usual place](/downloads/), and the full list of changes can be found [right here](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/raw/v1.0.0/NEWS) in the NEWS file.

Now jump to the [downloads page](/downloads/), grab a build for your favorite device and spread the word that ScummVM is 1.0.0!
