So, go grab your favorite games, and play through them using a [daily build](/downloads/#daily). If you find any bugs, report them on the [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). Once you've completed a game, please report it on [the forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=8495) so it can be added to the [release testing wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.1.0). When reporting, make sure you provide the version, language, and platform of the game you're testing. Any other questions? Go see the [Release Testing guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing).
