This year is the 20th anniversary of the release of the classic video game *Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb*. The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. has announced that it is developing a sequel entitled *Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows.*

This all-ages adventure game is set in a world of humanoid, anthropomorphic animal characters. The story follows Rif the Fox as he tries to confirm the rumors that an important relic of the legendary humans has survived and who is responsible for the relic's recovery. Unfortunately, there are sinister forces involved in the rumors — ones that endanger Rif, his friends, and his society.

"Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows will be enchanting and thrilling game for all to enjoy, with subtleties and hidden depths that can be appreciated by older players," said company president, Joe Pearce. "With the help of the backers to the funding drive, we expect to release a great game mid-2015."

A video demo has been released on the game's website at [http://InheritTheEarth2.com](http://InheritTheEarth2.com). The video provides a preview of the art, animation and play experience that will appear in the product.

In conjunction with this announcement, the company has launched a funding drive on Kickstarter to help in completing development of the game. Information about this drive can be found at [http://InheritTheEarth2.com/kickstarter](http://InheritTheEarth2.com/kickstarter).
