Since the 1.8.0 release we've been very busy with fixing small and big bugs in the newly supported engines, and now we are almost ready to present you the result in a form of the ScummVM 1.8.1.

Please, help us to test a few games, especially those which were not touched for a long time, or those which have significant changes in their engine. We prepared a short list on [our wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.8.1).

Also from now on we encourage you to test any game which we support and report any bugs or your success on the forum so we can keep track of current state of affairs in the ScummVM Land.

For testing the pre-release you need to download a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM. If you spot some glitches or bugs, please report them on our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). If everything went smoothly, please report your success on [the forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=14077), and we will instantly reflect it on the [wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.8.1) (yes, you can be famous for your testing efforts!) You can find a guide on how to test a new release [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing).

A few games are still missing [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots). Please help up complete our gallery.
