After more than two years since the original freeware release, the ScummVM Team is announcing an update for the *Dreamweb* packages.

Thanks to the work of Simon Sawatzki we have the game manuals as well as the *Diary of a (Mad?) Man* available in text and HTML format for the majority of our releases, so you can use your preferred text-to-speech program to read them as your bedtime story.

All releases now include these documents and are marked as version 1.1. Of course, the previously available high resolution scans will stay on the download page as well.

Additionally we have taken the opportunity to release the Italian version of the game.

All packages can be downloaded from our [Games page](/games/#dreamweb).
