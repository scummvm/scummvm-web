Twenty years after its original release, we are very proud to announce today the support of MTV's *Beavis and Butthead in Virtual Stupidity*. Accept the challenge of those anti-heroes of the 90's and help them find their way in an adventure full of puzzles and mini-games.

So, get the latest [daily build of ScummVM](/downloads/#daily) and your version of the game and give BBVS a try! Please post any bugs and unrecognized versions you can find to our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/), following the [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs).

As usual, if you find interesting sights, we are interested in your [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).
