Take a little break and compose yourself. After tireless weeks of work, the ScummVM team is proud to announce support for two children's adventure games — *Gregory and the Hot Air Balloon* and *Darby the Dragon* — And on top of that, you can also play some interactive books from the *Magic Tales* series. So, if you can find your childhood spirit, dig out your copies and enjoy those adorable games.

To play these, you'll need a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM. Any lurking bugs you find should be reported using our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/), and along the way, please consider making few screenshots, following our [guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).

We are also looking for additional information on localised versions and *Magic Tales* books. If you have one which is not recognized by the latest ScummVM daily build, please follow the guidelines [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Reporting_unknown_MD5_checksums) and report this to the team or as a bug.

Have fun!
