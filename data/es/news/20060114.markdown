As you may have noticed, there is a [big discussion](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=389) about the BASS score on our forums. James Woodcock, one of the participants, has posted on [his blog](http://www.jameswoodcock.co.uk/?page_id=54) a couple of remastered tracks from the original MIDI.

Although ScummVM does not yet support this in it's full glory, we are looking at implementing this in the near future, so keep watching.  In the mean time we recommend you to go and feel the future of what ScummVM hopes to provide.

You may find out more about the enhancements, by visiting James's site:
