It was not that long since our previous release, and now [here](/downloads/) is a new bugfix release hot off the press!

The list of fixed bugs is quite long, and you could read all of it in the [release notes](/frs/scummvm/0.13.1/ReleaseNotes), but here is a summary for those of you who are too lazy to follow the links and eager to play the games better.

SAGA: *Inherit the Earth* is completable again; AGOS, Groovie, Sword2: fixed many sound-related issues; Parallaction: fixed a bug in one of the puzzles; squashed a number of bugs in the GUI. Also iPhone, Symbian, WinCE ports are much improved and NDS and PS2 ports are back again since 0.11.0.

We won't bother you anymore with the details. Go, [download ScummVM](/downloads/) and enjoy your play!
