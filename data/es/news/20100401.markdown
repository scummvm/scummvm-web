Today, we would like to announce support for Urban Runner! The game has finally reached a completable state in our subversion tree. Now you can play as Max as he runs from the cops for being accused of a crime he didn't commit. You might even fall in love along the way.

We would really appreciate it if you would go and test this game for us. When you find bugs, go report them [here](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). When you have questions about reporting bugs, go [here](/faq/#question.report-bugs). Also, if you need a daily build, be sure to check out [this page](/downloads/#daily).

We have also collected a group of screenshots:
