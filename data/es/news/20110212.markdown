After having hosted our source code in Subversion for five years (to the day), we have today moved to the [Git](http://git-scm.com/)[distributed version control system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

The new repository page is at [https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm).

For users nothing should have changed, but for developers it should now be much easier to contribute to ScummVM.
