The ScummVM team, in close collaboration with Nayma soft (the legal rights owner) and DotEmu, is happy to announce support for *Tony Tough* in our development branch. The title is available for purchase from [DotEmu](http://www.dotemu.com/affiliate/32202/node/4600).

However, the game was tested only on Windows and Linux, so we would like to announce our usual testing period. Please grab the game from your attic or [purchase it](http://www.dotemu.com/affiliate/32202/node/4600) from DotEmu, test it with a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) and submit your bug reports to [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/).

We would also like to take this opportunity to announce the affiliation program with DotEmu: By buying games through [this link](http://www.dotemu.com/affiliate/32202) or by using the banner on the right side of the page, you will be supporting ScummVM.
