			<name>DOSBox</name>
			<url>http://www.dosbox.com/</url>

			even a PC to run it on; but since it can be used to run many classic DOS games (at least if you are using a
			sufficiently powerful desktop computer), we mention it here anyway. Plus it's a cool project, too :).</description>

Therefore we tried to collect some information about these engines in our <h:a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org">Wiki</h:a>. Sadly not everything is in there. But there are other sites out there that provide you with a bunch of information about some engines. Here are some of them.</description>
