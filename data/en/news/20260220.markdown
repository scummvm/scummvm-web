This year we also coming wiht the good news: We've been accepted again to the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) program!

So, if you love Adventuroe games or RPGs and would like to spend your summer with our cool team, we look forward to your application and participation.

Fear not—we will provide enough handholding, explanations, and support if you can dedicate time to coding on our project, are an open-minded developer ready to learn, and do not hesitate to ask any questions. We've been doing GSoC for the last 19 years (can't believe it!), so we know the drill.

A list of suggested projects can be found on [this page](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2026). If you have your own idea, we will gladly evaluate it. For example, this happened in 2023 with the [Crab engine](https://blogs.scummvm.org/hax0kartik/) which is now fully supported. The required information for your application for our project is listed on [our Wiki](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=GSoC_Application).

To give you a nice boost, we have put together an impressive amount of information on the [Google Summer of Code miniportal](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Summer_of_Code). So you can learn all the ins and outs of the process. But indeed, you need to start by joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4cDsMNtcpG) and follow the #scummvm-gsoc channel where you can engage with our mentors and the rest of the team.

We are looking forward to your fine application and participation!
