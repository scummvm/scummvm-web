You stumble upon an old handwritten book. It describes an island world named Myst. When you touch one of its last pages, you are transported to the island. As you explore Myst you learn about its inhabitants Atrus, Catherine and their sons Sirrus and Achenar. You quickly discover each son is trapped in a book. Will you solve the puzzles of the Myst ages and free them?
