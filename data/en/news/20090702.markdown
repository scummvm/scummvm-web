[Snowberry Connection](http://www.snowball.ru), [Société Pollene](http://www.gobliiins4.com) and ScummVM issued a [joint press release](/press/snowberry), which announces that the first three Gobliiins games are available as bonus downloads for those who purchased Gobliiins 4 via [GamersGate](http://gamersgate.com/DD-GOBLIN/gobliiins-4) or [Impulse](http://www.impulsedriven.com/goblins4). The games are also available on the DVD in at least the Russian and Hungarian releases of the game.

We are really happy that these art pieces of classic adventure gaming are available as a relatively easy purchase now, and that ScummVM helped Snowberry to make them run on modern systems with minimal effort.

Thanks, Snowberry!
