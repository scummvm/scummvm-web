Halloween is creeping closer… and what better way to celebrate than with a brand new game ready for testing in ScummVM?

We’re thrilled to announce that _Trick or Treat_, a Halloween-themed 1994 point and click adventure by ACA Soft, is now ready for public testing in the latest ScummVM daily builds!

As with all new game engines added to ScummVM, we need your help to ensure everything runs smoothly before declaring it officially supported. Grab your copy of _Trick or Treat_, fire up the latest [daily build](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#daily), and see how it fares!

Please report any issues you encounter to our [bug tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/), following our usual [testing guidelines](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing). Screenshots, save files, and detailed notes are always appreciated.

So light a pumpkin and get ready to test Trick or Treat this spooky season!
