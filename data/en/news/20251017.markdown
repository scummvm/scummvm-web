A kingdom in turmoil. Twin princesses kidnapped. And it's up to two intrepid heroes, Hodj and Podj, to compete in a gauntlet of minigames in order to rescue the princesses and escort them back to safety. The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for _Hodj ‘n' Podj_. This is the other Boffo Game that shared the Bagel engine with _The Space Bar_.

Special thanks go out to the folks at [Zoom Platform](https://www.zoom-platform.com/]Zoom-Platform) for supporting us in adding this game.

Help us test the game by grabbing a [daily build](https://scummvm.org/downloads/#daily). Read through our [testing guidelines](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing#Testing_Guidelines). And please take some [screenshots](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) along the way.

You can challenge the boardgame, run through all the minigames using the Grand Tour, or pick and choose specific minigames to play. Put your skills to the test, with either a one or two player experience, and find out who the true Hodj ‘n’ Podj champion is.
