Anybody wishing to enter the Website Revamp contest better get their entries in, only two days left!

So far we have only five entries. That's not too bad, but I was hoping for at least another five more. So if you're still sitting on an entry, SEND IT IN!

Please send all contest entries to [contest@scummvm.org](mailto:contest@scummvm.org). Further information on this contest is available a couple of posts down.
