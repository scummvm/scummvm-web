    The following lists some libraries and technologies ScummVM makes use of
    (depending on which system your run it and which configuration is chosen).
  links:
    - name: SDL
      notes: >-
        SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform multimedia library,
        and used by the primary backend of ScummVM.

    - name: MAD
      notes: >-
        MAD is a high-quality MPEG (MP3) audio decoder. ScummVM optionally
        supports playback of CD tracks and other audio data encoded using MP3.

    - name: Ogg Vorbis
      notes: >-
        Ogg Vorbis is a fully open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free,
        general-purpose compressed audio format. ScummVM optionally supports
        playback of CD tracks and other audio data encoded using Ogg Vorbis.

    - name: FLAC
      notes: >-
        FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified, FLAC
        is similar to MP3, but lossless, meaning that audio is compressed in
        FLAC without any loss in quality. ScummVM optionally supports playback
        of CD tracks and other audio data encoded using FLAC.

    - name: Scale2x/3x/4x
      notes: >-
        Scale2x is a real-time graphics effect able to increase the size of
        small bitmaps guessing the missing pixels without blurring the images.
        ScummVM optionally supports enlarging the game graphics using this
        scaler.

    - name: hq2x/3x/4x
      notes: >-
        The hq2x/3x/4x filters form a family of fast, high-quality magnification
        filters. ScummVM optionally supports enlarging the game graphics using
        these scaler.

        VOGONS is a large forum site, offering supports and tips for people who
        need help running older classic games on their modern computers and
        operating systems. If you want to play a game that ScummVM doesn't
        support, this is the place to ask for help!

      notes: >-
        MixNmojo is one of the longest running, and definitely largest,
        LucasArts sites out there. If your looking for information, hints,
        news... or even just a place to hang... with hosted and partnered sites
        catering for everything, the International House of Mojo should be your
        very first stop.

      notes: >-
        DoubleFine is the company of the lovable Tim Schafer, the genius behind
        some of the best of the worst gags and games in LucasArts history. Go
        buy Psychonauts, their new game. Because if you don't, the rats will get
        you and eat your family, computer and house. And poop everywhere.

        Revolution Software are the people behind such wonderful titles as
        Beneath a Steel Sky and the Broken Sword series of games. Revolution
        have provided us with the source code to some of these games so that we
        can add support for them, and allowed us to release BASS as freeware.
        Thanks guys!

- name: Technical information about SCUMM and other engines
  notes: >-
    SCUMM is a complex system that grew over many years. Understanding it can be
    quite difficult at times. Therefore we tried to collect some information
    about these engines in our <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org">Wiki</a>. Sadly
    not everything is in there. But there are other sites out there that provide
    you with a bunch of information about some engines. Here are some of them.
