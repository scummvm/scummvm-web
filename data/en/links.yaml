        FLAC without any loss in quality. ScummVM optionally supports playback
        of CD tracks and other audio data encoded using FLAC.

        scaler.

    - name: DOSBox
      description: >-
        DOSBox does not really quite fit in here since it emulates a classic
        operating system (namely DOS) and even a PC to run it on; but since it
        can be used to run many classic DOS games (at least if you are using a
        sufficiently powerful desktop computer), we mention it here anyway. Plus
        it's a cool project, too :).

- name: Technical information about SCUMM and other engines
  description: >-
    SCUMM is a complex system that grew over many years. Understanding it can be
    quite difficult at times. Therefore we tried to collect some information
    about these engines in our <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org">Wiki</a>. Sadly
    not everything is in there. But there are other sites out there that provide
    you with a bunch of information about some engines. Here are some of them.
