No, we haven't reached a settlement, we just got tired of waiting to release this gem.  \n  \nThere have been hundreds, if not thousands, of bugfixes since our last 0.2.0 release... not to mention support for at least three new games (The VGA version of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and support for The Dig and Simon the Sorcerer 2)... and new features such as a vastly improved in-game gui and a built-in launcher to make it even easier for you to add, configure, and run your classic LucasArts (and AdventureSoft) games.

Please enjoy this release as much as we've became frustrated making it, and remember - if you give all your money to LucreArts, maybe they'll let us live instead of abandoning us on... on.... Monkey Island! (Ugh, Bananas... I hate Bananas).  \n  \nFor those interested in the boring news, here's both a summary and an update on our legal situation, for those users who are just now discovering ScummVM.\n\n* * *\n\n*We've been at a deadlock with LucasArts for some time now. LucasArts simply do not like our current license, the GPL (General Public License). While we do not think it necessary, we have agreed to change the license to something more LucasArts-'friendly'. However, LucasArts wish us to include distribution terms which are against section one of both the [Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)](http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines) and the [Open Source Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html). We cannot agree to this, nor the condition they wish to require (no commercial distribution)... because it conflicts with the DFSG and OSD, which we require, and it is something we legally cannot be sure of enforcing - several Linux and BSD distributions already include ScummVM packages, and we cannot be certain they will notice a license change. Oh, and we WANT distributions to be able to include our software :)  \n  \nTo date, LucasArts has not been able to give us any firm complaints regarding ScummVM, besides some vague claims that if they didn't enforce these conditions on us, it would effectively give up their rights to their own Intellectual Property. We do not believe this, there certainly have not been any documented cases of the GPL leading to such a challenge in the past, and far more important properties have been licensed under the GPL in the past, such as the Quake titles from [id software](http://www.idsoftware.com/). LucasArts isn't releasing any of their own code under the GPL, and we really do not believe that they should require us to change our license - all we want them to do is leave us alone to create our emulator. Sanction us, if it makes them feel safer legally. But if they are going to require such a major step on our part of changing our license, they at least have to capitulate on the point of OSD/DFSG compliance.  \n  \nWe here at the ScummVM team would like to thank the people at LucasArts who are supporting us, and attempting to help us come to an arrangement. But guys, we're your fans. All we are doing is updating the engine for games, in a form of an emulator... because you haven't - although we've asked you to for years. We've even made more money for you, as quite a number of us have went out and BOUGHT your classic bundle packs, just to play it with ScummVM.*  \n  \n\n**These last few paragraphs have been brought to you by the \"Please don't sue us for making a new release\" department.**"

        "title": "Murray Christmas",
        "content": "We here on the ScummVM team hope everybody had a good Christmas!  \n  \nFirst we would like to mention that LucasArts has put out a pack, at least in the UK, featuring updated versions of Sam and Max and Full Throttle, designed to work with Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2K/XP. This pack (entitled, imaginatively, \"The Entertainment Pack\") also comes with The Dig and Grim Fandango... these versions have not been updated, and are the original Windows versions (yes, these games DID come with native Windows ports in some of the earlier LucasArts Adventure Packs).  \n  \nThe updated Sam and Max and Full Throttle engines were not ported in-house by LucasArts, likely because of a lack of time AND because most people who worked on SPUTM/SCUMM have left anyway, but by Aaron Giles - the original Mac Porter (and renown MAME developer :). There are no modifications except for a DirectX wrapper around the graphics code and a really really bad graphics scaler.  \n  \nOur take? Call us biased, but unless you *need* perfect compatibility, want to play Full Throttle now, or are missing more than two of these games - it will probably be far cheaper to buy these games second-hand or individually. The included updated binaries are inferior feature-wise to ScummVM, as you miss out on our enhanced features, such as support for platforms -other- than Windows (such as Macintosh, Unix and PocketPC), our graphics scalers, etc. Of course, if you do purchase the pack, the game datafiles are unchanged and of course compatible with ScummVM anyway. It *is* nice to see LucasArts releasing something like this, and doing something positive to try and revive their classic games - or at least drum up marketing hype for the sequel :)  \n  \nFinal conclusion, buy it if you want it or are a collector - but it's not worth the money simply for Windows compatibility. However if you do purchase it, you ARE encouraging LucasArts to update more classics in the future - although hopefully ScummVM will make such a need obsolete shortly. We suggest LucasArts spend it's development costs on re-releasing it's lost and RARE classics, like the FmTowns 256 color version of Zak Mckracken. For those interested, the updated versions were compiled on October 2nd for Full Throttle, and October 24th for Sam and Max.  \n  \nIn development news, several ScummVM developers have actually been really boring people and *coded* this Christmas, coming up over just a few days with the basics for Curse of Monkey Island support. I'm sure our Macintosh users will be happy to hear they will, in maybe as little as a month, finally be able to play this game. Support is in the latest CVS and Daily Builds, but **do NOT file bug reports** as we know it doesn't really work or do anything at the moment. Full support will be available \"When It's Done\".. or the day after Duke Nukem Forever comes out. Whichever is first.  \n  \nHo Ho Ho!"

This is somewhat of an open plea, although we do not really expect morons who have done something so idiotic to listen.  \n  \nSorry for this open message being so harsh guys, but do you not realise that by associating and bundling ScummVM **with** pirated copies (\"Abandonware\" or otherwise) of LucasArts games, you're basically giving them even more excuse to take legal action against us (and bring possible financial ruin on the developers of this program :)... I'm especially disappointed in chrilith who has almost certainly guaranteed that, unless we feel very forgiving, there will never be an official Palm port of ScummVM integrated into CVS.  \n  \nIf you appreciate what we are doing, and have done, then do not abuse it. Otherwise you are damaging the reputation, and possible legal status of both ScummVM and its developers. I've seen some VERY ridiculous comments on the Clie Source forums to the effect that LucasArts do not sell these games anymore. With the exception of some versions (specifically Zak256 and LoomCD), this is stupid. Most LucasArts games can be ordered in collection packs from Amazon or the LucasArts store (if you live in America.). Heck, I saw a bunch of LucasArts classic adventures in Electronic Boutique when I was Christmas Shopping.\n\n* * *\n\nIn other news, Curse of Monkey Island support is progressing nicely!

Within just several weeks, remarkable progress has been made on support for this game, but work will likely be slowed for the next week as various developers are otherwise occupied.

While there are still a number of small graphical glitches, currently we are down to two known gameplay-critical bugs and a number of other 'inconveniences' and cases of incorrect behavior. We hope to be able to announce Curse of Monkey Island completable very soon.  \n  \nA lot of people have been asking where we are going from here. Here is a brief (very subject to change!) guide to our next few targets:\n\n*   February 2003: Curse of Monkey Island completable\n*   Feb - Mar 2003: Regression testing/bugfixes for other supported games\n*   Feb - Mar 2003: Completion of the Launcher functionality (tabbed option dialogs, etc)\n*   Early March 03: CVS Freeze, Regression testing, 0.4.0 release\n*   March onwards: V1/V2 game support (Maniac Mansion, non-FmTowns Zak, EGA Loom, etc.)\n\n  \n  \nAs usual, this is but a rough guideline depending on both progress and free time for our developers. If you want to help, and know how to use CVS and a compiler... either fix bugs, or regression test! We are very much looking for people to test CVS with games other than ComI and look for critical bugs that were not present in 0.3.0b, then attempt to try different versions of CVS and locate at least the day when the bug started occurring. This allows us to more easily determine what changes have caused problems, without spending weeks blindly guessing.  \n  \nNeedless to say, if you find a critical bug that IS also present in 0.3.0b, check for a bug report. If one isn't present, please submit one!"

ScummVM is a graphic adventure game interpreter designed to allow users to play many classic adventure game titles on various computer systems; (Linux, Windows 2000/XP, \\*BSD, Mac OS X, PocketPC/Handheld PC, Palm, Dreamcast and more)\n\nVersion 0.6.0 brings with it a new milestone in ScummVM history, with all LucasArts/LucasFilm SCUMM adventure titles now being supported. We are also proud to announce in conjunction with ScummVM 0.6.0 the release of the classic adventure game 'Flight of the Amazon Queen' (originally available for the Amiga and DOS) as freeware. The ScummVM team would like to thank the authors Steve Stamatiadis and John Passfield for providing the team with the source code to this classic game, and allowing us to release it.\n\nSo, what's new?\n\nScummVM 0.6.0 includes, as usual, many bugfixes in all supported game engines. There have also been dramatic fixes and improvements in the area of sound and music, as well as a greatly improved game management/options screen and two new graphics modes (HQ2x and HQ3x). Most importantly, we have also added new support for the following games:\n\n*   The classic V1 versions of the original LucasArts SCUMM games Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken and the LucasArts SCUMM game 'Full Throttle'\n*   Broken Sword 1 and Broken Sword 2. Many thanks to Revolution for providing us with the source-code to these games.\n*   Support for Flight of the Amazon Queen. Thanks to Steve and John for providing us with the source code to this game, and permitting its release as freeware.\n\nScummVM 0.6.0, the two freeware games Flight of the Amazon Queen and Beneath a Steel Sky, as well as converted cutscenes required for playing Broken Sword 1 and Broken Sword 2 may be downloaded from the [Download Page](/downloads/)"

        "content": "April 1st, THE INTERNET: The [FreeSCI](http://freesci.org/), [Sarien](http://sarien.sourceforge.net/) and [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org/) teams today announced the formation of CABAL (Coalesced 'Adventures beyond Architecture' League), a universal adventure game interpreter. This new project will unite the strengths and capabilities of the projects involved, creating what the project members believe will be a revolution for adventure game fans around the globe.\n\nWhen asked about the relevance of CABAL for the worldwide adventure gaming market, ScummVM project lead Max Horn commented that \"\\[with\\] the market for adventure titles waning, we believe that the formation of a project with the explicit goal of running every adventure game ever released will infuse it with new life.\" FreeSCI maintainer Lars Skovlund added that \"this will certainly cause an upheaval in the gaming world. Adventure game fans around the world, rejoice!\".\n\nIn addition to supporting LucasArts' SCUMM games (including famous titles such as \"Monkey Island\", \"Indiana Jones\" and \"Sam and Max\"), Sierra's SCI and AGI lines (\"King's Quest\", \"Leisure Suit Larry\", \"Space Quest\"...), and other games already supported by the retrospective engines, the newly united team plans to continue to add further titles to their already impressive list.\n\nSome of the juicy new modules include:\n\n*   An Infocom module (based on the [Frotz Z-machine interpreter](http://www.cs.csubak.edu/~dgriffi/proj/frotz/)), so you can now play your favorite text adventures anywhere you go!\n*   [Exult](http://exult.sourceforge.net) is being merged in as a plugin, allowing Ultima 7 fans around the world to play their favorite game on the many platforms already supported by the CABAL component engines - including Palm/PocketPC PDAs and the Dreamcast.\n*   Revolution software has offered the source-code for Broken Sword 3, which will be added to the titles supported by the upcoming CABAL3D project - alongside with Grim Fandango and, possibly, Ultima IX (negotiations are ongoing).\n*   Support for the SNES games Final Fantasy IV through VI (Japanese numbering, i.e. FF2/FF3 according to US releases) is planned for sometime this Fall. Whilst these are not strictly adventure games, the storyline and plots in this series are more imaginative than any 'action adventure' title published in recent years.\n\nOffers by various companies, including Microsoft and Amiga International, to buy out the team have been gently but firmly declined by the leads of the joint project. \"We know that we could earn a lot of money from this, but we are idealists and at this time we have the goal to reform the worlds adventure market. Once that is achieved, we can reconsider about making some money out of this.\""

Over the last several days there has been heated debate regarding several important design issues, and current tension in the team has risen to an insurmountable level.\n\n\"It's really unfortunate\", Max Horn, senior developer on ScummVM and Exult, was quoted as saying, \"but \\[former FreeSCI maintainer\\] Christoph \\[Reichenbach\\]'s ideas of aligning curly braces with the left-hand side of function declarations while appending them to the end of the line for 'while' and 'for' loops did not make any sense at all.\"  \nThe latter replied by pointing out that \"using anything but tabs for indentation is calling for trouble.\"\n\nClaudio Matsuoka, of the Sarien project, pointed out his disappointment and noted that he didn't see much of a point in trying to co-operate with people entirely incapable of reaching agreements on such trivial issues. \"I mean, we haven't even resolved the entire EMACS vs. vi dispute, and they're already at each other's throats again.\"  \nJames Brown, another senior developer on the ScummVM project, sadly announced that he was laughed out of the project meer hours before a decision to split was made. \"They just said I didn't belong, since I prefer nano as a editor...\" he admitted."

This provoked quite a bit of argument within the ScummVM team as to whether this is considered an adventure and within ScummVMs goals.\n\nAfter much debate, the engine author (cyx) decided that it would be more convenient to continue the project seperate from ScummVM. It has now been removed, and future information and development will occur as part of the [RAW](http://membres.lycos.fr/cyxdown/raw/) project.

This was noticed and fixed in the experimental CVS version, but the fix was mistakenly left out of the ScummVM 0.6.1 release.\n\nIf you encounter this glitch, the recommended work around is to set the Extra Path to the saved game directory.

Sorry for letting you wait so long on the outcome.\n\nNow, to determine the winner, we conducted an internal poll with the team. This took some time until all team members were able to submit their filled out forms. That process didn't produce a clear winner, though. So then, some of us wanted to conduct a poll amongst you, dear users, to pick the winner out of the three finalists.

We'll let this polling go for about 14 days, at which point we'll finally decide on the winner.\n\nOn another matter, we have now started work on the next major release of ScummVM. 0.7.0 is (rather aggressively) scheduled for Christmas 2004! We hope to be able to deliver a nice christmas present to you this way. But for this to work out, we need your help: We need people who actively test the latest CVS so that we can iron out and fix all remaining issues with it, to ensure a high quality release.\n\nIf you want to help, check out the [release status page](http://www.scummvm.org/documentation.php?view=release) for a list of games which need testing.\n\nThat's it for today, hopefully the next time around we can announce something more substantial (like a new release or a new website). Until then: happy play testing to all of you!\n\nP.S.: Maybe you also have been wondering Gee, will these guys ever reach 1.0? As a matter of fact, we are now working towards this goal. There is basically a single major piece missing for that: a good user manual.

So far, Gobliiins 1 is completable. Work on the other parts (Gobliins 2, Goblins 3, and \"The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble\") has not yet begun, but at least Gobliins 2 seems to be similar to part 1, so we hope to have that in the foreseeable future, too. Regarding the other parts, we'll see...\n*   Thanks to the hard work of some dedicated people we also finally support the (in)famous NES version of Maniac Mansion. Wow, that should be about the last LucasArts SCUMM game we were not supporting ... ;-)\n*   Support for Humongous Entertainment's kids games is progressing well, the following titles can be completed with the current development version of ScummVM:\n    *   Freddi Fish 1 - 4\n    *   Pajama Sam 1 & 2\n    *   Putt-Putt (several titles)\n    *   Spy Fox 1 & 2\n    *   Several arcade titles\n\n**New thumbs**\n\n*   No, I didn't undergo plastic surgery (although another pair of thumbs sounds tempting...). Rather, we added support for thumbnails in SCUMM savegames. Pretty cool stuff, click [here for a screenshot](/data/news/20050511.png).\n\nNot too shabby, we think.

In case you wonder, a versioning system is a tool for collaborative software development. As you probably know, the ScummVM Team consists of more than 30 active core developers, and many more are on our list of past and present contributors. Working on a project on this scale just would not be possible without the help of such a system.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Ludvig Strigeus committed his initial ScummVM version to CVS, the versioning system we used until recently. Vincent Hamm joined him shortly thereafter. Since then, a lot has changed, many things have happened. We have more than 20,000 revisions of ScummVM and its various components in our CVS repository.\n\nWe now moved to a new system, Subversion. Compared to CVS, it adds many useful new features, that allow us to work more efficiently on ScummVM, something we are sure all our users will appreciate. Among other things, there will be no more lag between anonymous and developers version of the source code -- you get everything we do instantly!\n\nIf you used a CVS checkout so far, scrap it, install a [Subversion client](http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html) and checkout\n\n https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/ \n\nIf you are using the command line subversion client, that means you simply have to type the following command:\n\n svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/ scummvm \n\nYou will notice that the source tree of ScummVM already changed significantly and yet more is to come.

        "content": "Some time ago PayPal approached us and told us that we could no longer use their system to accept donations. It was a precedent, which was even highlighted on Slashdot. But as you may imagine, it could potentially put many projects into a very unpleasant situation.\n\nFortunately, thanks to the very good folks at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net) we now have this issue resolved. They were able to help negotiate an exception with PayPal, allowing us to continue to accept PayPal donations via SourceForge.\n\nThis all means that now we are able to accept donations again via the [SourceForge donation system](https://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=37116) which uses PayPal.\n\nWe also would like to use this opportunity to announce a fundraiser. As you may know, we are widely using Interactive Disassembler from [DataRescue](http://www.datarescue.com/idabase/index.htm). So far most of us have been using the freeware version, but it has many serious limitations (which obviously makes it free). We conducted negotiations with DataRescue and received a very generous discount. We would really like to buy 5 IDA Pro licenses for several key team developers who will be able to use it at full extent. So if you would really like to see the project going steady and support for even more games added, consider to donating a couple of dollars or euros.\n\nOur target is $950 US dollars and whilst this no small goal, taking into account more that 2,5 millions downloads, 15,000+ web visitors per day and almost 5,400 registered forum users we feel that it is very achievable. Please, use the [SourceForge donation system](https://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=37116) to make your donations."

The response was simply amazing, and thanks to these donations several key team members will soon be the proud owners of some shiny new copies of the latest release of [IDA - The Interactive Disassembler](http://www.datarescue.com/idabase/index.htm).\n\nThis will be a great help in adding new game support, and fixing some of the odder bugs in our current game engines, so once again we thank all users that have donated. Everyone on the team is amazed at the support you've shown, and we're planning a few surprises down the line to help thank everybody. Please check our [Donor List](https://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=37116) to see how many donations we received, and to read everybody's comments. (Note that only donors who supplied a comment are listed).\n\nHowever, although the fundraiser is closed, (and especially if you didn't donate in this round), please consider donating in the future if you enjoy ScummVM. We can always use donations to help purchase game software and rare versions to increase our support and compatibility — every dollar or euro is appreciated!"

There are over 180 AGI fan games that have been made using something like WinAGI or AGI Studio that can be played in ScummVM. Luckily for us, sev has made a compilation of them that can be found [here](http://www.unet.univie.ac.at/~a0200586/binary/mirrors/scummvm/agi-fanmade.tar.bz2) (thanks to **clemmy** for hosting it).\n\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" you might ask.

We need you, the ScummVM users, to go write a description for the wiki for the fan games, using the syntax written in [this](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?p=18590) forum post. Then, post it there as well. This way, the wiki editors can post it on the wiki.\n\nIn addition, we ask that you test both Sierra's AGI games and fan made games using ScummVM. As usual, you will need a daily build. However, we ask that you check if a bug in an AGI fan game is present in the original interpreter as well.

Finally in July '07 we received the sources and a few months later they finally freewared it and gave us an official permission distribute the game.\n\nThe original version of the game is in Spanish with full voice overs and subtitles. Then there exists an English version with full voice overs and subtitles, and finally there are subtitles in German, French and Italian. Of course, there is also a full musical score which came as a set of audio tracks on the CD (the game was CD-only).

The main change is that the lowercase \"s\" has now become an uppercase \"S\" -- this is meant to help stop the confusion lots of people seem to have about our name: We are called \"ScummVM\", and not \"scummvm\" :-).\n\nBesides that, the new logo was touched up by its original author, Jean-Marc, to produce higher quality versions (in PNG and SVG format) of both the logo and the icon. As a result, they look better and yummier than ever before.\n\nWe are not yet completely done converting everything to the new logo and icon (boy, they are really present in *lots* of places), but are actively working on it. The upcoming 1.0.0 release of ScummVM will be the first to feature the new art everywhere.\n\nSo, I hope you like the new art just as much as we do :-)."

Also the background music in *Pajama Sam 1* isn't working correctly in the Kitchen and Mine areas anymore.\n\nWe are not happy about that, but in the end decided that we should not let this hold up the other new cool stuff we added.

You may jump straight there, or stay a bit longer and see what cool new features are included.\n\nAs you have probably already realized, this release has support for SCI, and moreover, [the list of compatible](/compatibility/1.2.0/) games goes beyond the original FreeSCI which was merged about 1.5 years ago. We support *Conquests of Camelot/the Longbow*, *Castle/Island of Dr. Brain*, *Codename: ICEMAN*, *EcoQuest 1&2*, *all four Hoyle games*, *Freddy Pharkas*, *Jones in the Fast Lane*, *King's Quest I-VI*, both *Laura Bow* games, *Larry* up to 6 (low-res 6 only), *Police Quest 1-3*, *Quest for Glory I-III*, *Space Quest up to V* and a few others. Incredible work by the FreeSCI team and our own SCI engine team!\n\nEarly SCI 16-color games can be optionally undithered by ScummVM, making them look much better. To see a comparison between undithered graphics and the original, watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FScrBr16vkM) produced by one of our SCI engine developers and see for yourself.\n\nBesides SCI, we have added support for yet another Coktel Vision game called *Fascination* and we have a number of new ports: Android, Dingux, Caanoo and OpenPandora. Unfortunately we had to declare the PalmOS port officially dead.\n\nAs usual there are tons of engine-specific bug fixes. Take a look at the [release notes](https://downloads.scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/1.2.0/ReleaseNotes) if you want to know more. But wait! We would like to tell a little bit about another long-awaited feature new in this release. After all these years we are finally going international, and the ScummVM GUI can be translated into any language (well, almost any). Right now we have Catalan, English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian localizations. Besides this there are a lot of smaller improvements like tooltips, radio buttons, improved usability and we support more games running from original media without the need to shuffle the game files.\n\nEnough talking!

The (sadly) now grown-up ScummVM team no longer has all of these games lying around, so we need *your* help in testing the games to weed out any remaining bugs.\n\nThe first batch of supported Living Books games consists of *Just Grandma and Me* (v1), *Arthur's Teacher Trouble*, *Aesop's Fables: The Tortoise and the Hare*, *Ruff's Bone*, *The New Kid on the Block*, *Arthur's Birthday* (v1), *Little Monster at School*, *Harry and the Haunted House*, *The Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight*, *Dr. Seuss's ABC*, *Sheila Rae, the Brave*, *The Berenstain Bears in the Dark*, *Stellaluna*, and most of *Green Eggs and Ham*. We hope to support the rest of the games in the future, but in the meantime, we hope that these are enough to keep our loyal users occupied.\n\nBe sure to grab a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) when testing.

Unfortunately, this currently only works with the Kinect for Linux drivers.\n\nThe code is still very much a work-in-progress, but we've put up some screenshots of various developers testing out their favorite games in ScummVM.

From there, we just plugged in our simple dialog and achievement tracking code, and were able to add it to all engines easily. Soon integration with the forums will be complete and you will be able to share all your achievements there.\n\nLordHoto was really excited to work on this feature saying, \"This is the coolest feature I've added to The Legend of Kyrandia.\" \"First Steam's achievements came to Linux and now this?

It has been many months since the last official release... but in that time, tons of work has been done, resulting in one of our biggest ScummVM releases to date!\n\nScummVM 1.8 adds support for *ten* new games using eight brand new game engines:\n\n*   *Amazon: Guardians of Eden*\n*   *Beavis and Butthead in Virtual Stupidity*\n*   *Broken Sword 2.5: The Return of the Templars*\n*   *Labyrinth of Time*\n*   *Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender*\n*   *Sfinx*\n*   *The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Rose Tattoo*\n*   *The Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Serrated Scalpel*\n*   *Zork: Grand Inquisitor*\n*   *Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands*\n\nIn addition to new game support, we've updated the MT-32 emulator to the latest upstream version of munt, and switched AdLib to Miles Audio for those games which originally supported it. This means games in ScummVM sound better than ever!\n\nWe've also overhauled the graphics subsystem in AGI, basically replacing it. As a result game compatibility with old Sierra titles is high as never before, and even includes platform-specific system dialogs, palette and font for Apple IIgs, Atari ST and Amiga versions of the games. Game speed for Apple IIgs is handled properly now. And it's even possible to switch to the looks of another platform.\n\nNew ports include GCW-Zero (yes, sev finally got one from the Kickstarter) and Raspberry Pi.\n\nAlso, along the way we have moved to a new server and added translation capabilities to our main website. If you'd like to help with translation, [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Translate_ScummVM_Web_Site) is the link with the guide.\n\nThis list is far from complete. The more comprehensive version of it can be found in [the release notes](https://downloads.scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/1.8.0/ReleaseNotes) and the binaries for your platforms are available from our [downloads page](/downloads/). The porters are still building their packages, so please be patient if you do not see the up to date download for your platform yet.\n\nDon't get lost in the Labyrinth, and in the worst case call Mr. Holmes!

ScummVM 1.8.1 is now available with fixes for important bugs and support for even more platforms.\n\nOne of the most important \"features\" of this release is a major upgrade to the Android port. This upgrade also adds support for the OUYA console. We are currently working on bringing this new release straight to Google Play, but for the impatient among you, feel free to go ahead and [install the APKs manually](/downloads). The Android port now comes in two flavours, our \"classic\" OpenGL-based one, and a new variant based on SDL. The SDL port has better compatibility with some Android devices and also works better with some engines. Please give it a try and tell us on [our forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewforum.php?f=17) or via the [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) about your experience.\n\nWe will also be adding Nintendo 3DS support! As of release time, the new binaries have not yet been built by our new porter, but they should be available soon. Keep your eyes peeled!\n\n64-bit Mac binaries now include experimental automatic update checking using [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/). Auto-updating is selected as an opt-in during your first start up, and by default checks weekly for new releases. When version 1.9.0 is released, users of 1.8.1 will be presented with a nice dialog for updating. If you'd like to see a similar feature for Windows or other platforms, let us know! All the details on how the update process works can be found [here](https://sparkle-project.org/).\n\nNo ScummVM release would be complete without game engine updates! ScummVM 1.8.1 includes fixes for *Drascula*, *Legend of Kyrandia*, *Labyrinth of Time*, localized versions of *I Have No Mouth*, *Broken Sword 2.5* and improvements to the Windows, OS X and GCW0 ports.\n\nThe full list of changes included in this release can be found in [the release notes](https://downloads.scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/1.8.1/ReleaseNotes) and the binaries are provided on our [downloads page](/downloads/).\n\nGet ready, grab your beloved Android device, install ScummVM on it, and play!"

The ScummVM team itself also had some manual tasks to perform, such as updating the translation templates from the source code when needed or rebuilding the binary translation file after receiving a translator's contribution.\n\nAll this belongs to the past. Now, thanks to our new [translations website](https://translations.scummvm.org/), powered by [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), updating the translations is easier and more comfortable than ever before. Translation templates are updated automatically when needed, and so is the binary translation data file. Translators now just have to translate. That's it. The website also helps translators by performing automated quality checks and suggesting (machine) translations.\n\nFinally, the new site also adds a community aspect to translations, enabling users to vote for suggested translations and even make their own suggestions. Anybody can view the translations, but you will need to log in to make suggestions, comment, and vote. You can log in using your GitHub or Facebook account, or by creating an account on the website. You will still need to contact us if you want to contribute further (for example to start a new translation or help on an existing one), as we will need to grant you access to the Translators group. Unlike regular users, translators can accept or reject suggestions and modify translations directly. Contact us by visiting the #scummvm IRC channel on irc.freenode.net or by sending an email to [translation@scummvm.org](mailto:translation@scummvm.org) if you are interested in becoming an official translator.

As you can imagine, it will take us some time to review and get it merged.\n\nHowever, you can already grab the source code from [this pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/pull/932), build a copy and play it (only PC version supported currently).

However, the addition today of an engine for *Plumbers Don't Wear Ties* changes everything.

We are now **PlumberVM**!\n\nWe used the name ScummVM for over 15 years, and this is with sadness that we say goodbye to it. It is a well known name and we do not underestimate the effort it will take to get the same recognition for our new name. Thus we are calling on your help to spread the news. In the short term this will inevitably lead to some disruption and confusion. But in the long term we are convinced that this is the right decision. With your support we will conquer the world! Starting from the sewers.\n\nWith the change of name we have also decided to expand even more the scope of our project. Last year we decided to accept engines for RPG games in addition to adventure games. Now we are also accepting any games that feature a plumber. Work has already started on the little known *Super Mario Bros.*, and we have big plans for the future. We will have a big announcement soon, so stay tuned.\n\nOn a final note, it will take time for us to update all the places where our name appears. We have started today with our main website and you will notice in the next few days the change spreading to our social media accounts, wiki, forum and the pages not yet updated on our web site. We are also working on releasing PlumberVM 2.0 with the addition of two new supported games: *Plumbers Don't Wear Ties* and *Full Pipe*.

Open source organizations provide mentors and projects to work on, while Google give some money to participating students. You can find more information on the [official web site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com). We also have some information on [our wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code), and in particular [project rules](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/Project_Rules) that applicants will need to follow.\n\nAre you a motivated student? Are you available between May 14 and August 6? Do you want to be a contributor to one of the largest game preservation projects? Then ScummVM and ResidualVM are waiting for you! Have a look at [our ideas page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2018) or bring your own idea! Students have until March 27 to write and submit proposals for the project they want to work on. The accepted proposals will be announced on April 23, and there will be a few weeks for community bonding before the start of the 12 week coding period on May 14.\n\nIn any case, don't hesitate to chat with us on IRC!

This is obviously a problem for potential contributors, as well as potential GSoC students wanting to reverse engineer an old adventure game or RPG for their project. The obvious solution is to provide an earlier freeware version that still supports them.\n\nConsulting with Hex-Rays, they're kindly consented for us to host one of the earlier IDA freeware versions, for those in the future who wish to use it. After reviewing the earlier versions, we've settled on [IDA Freeware Version 5.0](https://downloads.scummvm.org/frs/extras/IDA/idafree50.exe). IDA 5.0 was the first version of IDA that added the convenient graph view, and this freeware version has both it as well as the ability to disassemble DOS executables. It's also not time limited like the demo versions, it's the most convenient for enthusiasts to try their hand at reverse engineering old games.\n\nConsidering how many of our game engines have been created by reverse engineering the original games, hopefully we will continue to see people interested in re-implementing games in the future.\n\nThe more the merrier :)"

This year, Aryan Rawlani will help improving support for languages written from right to left ('RTL') as well as adding proper Unicode support to the ScummVM GUI. Imagine ScummVM being available in every possible language one day and you might understand how important Aryan's work is. Besides that, Aryan will also work on the mechanics we use to detect your games in order to improve reliability and performance, which includes deep rework on how our plugin system works.\n\nDuring GSoC, ScummVM also acts as an umbrella organisation for its sister project [ResidualVM](https://www.residualvm.org). Gunnar Birke will work on implementing support for the Wintermute 3D engine to ResidualVM. Wintermute 3D is the - you guessed it - 3D counterpart to the Wintermute engine supported by ScummVM which is only able to play 2D games due to the project's scope. Adding support for Wintermute 3D to ResidualVM will eventually allow you to run games like [*Alpha Polaris*](https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/alpha-polaris).\n\nBrace yourselves - Summer 2020 is coming. Prepare for supporting our students on their glorious adventure. When your watch begins, follow their process on the [ScummVM Planet](https://planet.scummvm.org/)."

We are excited to announce that ScummVM has been accepted as a participant of [Google Season of Docs 2020](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). One of the most important parts of every open source project is its documentation. Good documentation is vital for making the project accessible to both end users and new developers wanting to have a deeper look into the project's internals so they can start contributing on their own.\n\nSeason of Docs, a recent initiative by Google to connect technical writers with open source projects. The program offers a great way to gain practical project experience, as well as explore the world of free software and the great communities that evolve around them. \n\nFor ScummVM this is a wonderful opportunity to improve our documentation. You can check out our [ideas page](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Season_of_Docs/GSoD_Ideas) or if you want to bring up your own ideas - get in touch with us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6TBm9hJ).\n\nWe've had a lot of successful student projects as part of Google's Summer of Code in previous years - we’re looking forward to carrying that success into Google's Season of Docs and inspire you to work with us and add your very own success.\n\nThe deadline for proposals is July 9.

        "content": "Many years ago, a company called Origin Systems developed the much beloved Ultima series of role-playing games. Thanks to the previous hard work of others who created stand-alone reimplementations of these games, ScummVM is pleased to announce that two of the games in the series are ready for testing.\n\nThe first of these games is Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, based on the prior work done by the xu4 project. You can detect your English copy of Ultima IV as either original or enhanced. Enhanced mode uses the VGA graphics developed by the xu4 project. With the inclusion into ScummVM, the game also receives several improvements, such as multiple savegame slots and configurable keybindings. It even adds in a small secret area that only the most dedicated explorers may find.\n\nThe second game is Ultima VI, based on the Nuvie project. Due to some miscommunication, Nuvie may still advance as a separate project, but given the work done integrating Nuvie into ScummVM, we're hoping to have it officially supported in ScummVM as well. As with Ultima IV, Ultima VI supports the original game mode, as well as an enhanced mode that allows for Nuvie's full screen map, container gumps as in Ultima VII, and other features. Note that enhanced mode defaults to double resolution, so for now, the intro only displays in half of the screen.\n\nSo break out your copies of the games and give them a try! You will need a [daily development build](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/#/snapshots). As always, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/)."

And second, something else finally happened, something which has been in the talks for a long time: The ScummVM project is officially merging with the ResidualVM project.\n\nFor a long time ScummVM limited itself to 2D point-and-click adventure games, and so ResidualVM was born as a sister project to support 3D games. But from now on, there will be no more confusion about which project a game belongs to. ScummVM now embraces adventure games and RPGs, whether they are 2D or 3D, point-and-click or not. It is a natural step for both projects which have been developed alongside each other and cross-pollinating each other with ideas, patches and design decisions. Moreover, several developers belonged to both projects.\n\nWith this merger, ScummVM adds several games to our supported list: _Grim Fandango_, _Escape from Monkey Island_, _Myst III - Exile_, _The Longest Journey_ and an unfinished engine for _In Cold Blood_, as well as Wintermute 3D engine.\n\nWe’re excited to embrace most of the ResidualVM team and will continue development together.\n\nOf course, there are still more things to do and, in the coming weeks, you will see more project resources merging like forums, wikis, etc.\n\nStay tuned and go 3D!"

With this release we announce support for _Grim Fandango_, _The Longest Journey_ and _Myst 3: Exile_. This is why we jumped straight to 2.5 in our versioning. Please note that only desktop platforms currently support these games and other platforms may or may not gain the support later depending on their capabilities.\n\nIn addition to these 3 games and engines, we officially support 10 more new engines and subengines that add compatibility with the following games:\n\n* _Little Big Adventure_\n* _Red Comrades 1: Save the Galaxy_\n* _Red Comrades 2: For the Great Justice_\n* _Transylvania_\n* _Crimson Crown_\n* _OO-Topos_\n* [Glulx interactive fiction games](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Glk/Glulxe)\n* _Private Eye_\n* [AGS Games versions 2.5+](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=AGS/Games)\n* _Nightlong: Union City Conspiracy_\n* _The Journeyman Project 2: Buried in Time_\n* _Crusader: No Remorse_\n* _L-ZONE_\n* _Spaceship Warlock_\n\nWe love localized game releases and multiple platform versions, thus with this release, we enhanced the support for _Lure of the Temptress_ Konami release, _Blue Force_ Spanish, _Ringworld_ Spanish, _Amazon: Guardians of Eden_ Spanish, _Mystery House_ French, Russian translations of Sierra AGI games, _Elvira 1_ Japanese PC-98, _Bargon Attack_ Russian, _Woodruff_ Russian, _Eye of the Beholder_ Japanese Sega-CD, _Legend of Kyrandia_ Hebrew, _Legend of Kyrandia 2_ Hebrew, _Legend of Kyrandia 3_ Simplified Chinese, _Inherit the Earth_ PC-98 Japanese, _Gabriel Knight 1_ Macintosh, _Xeen_ Russian to name but a few. Notably, Macintosh b/w versions of _Loom_ and _Indy 3_ are now also supported.\n\nBesides the new games and game versions, ScummVM 2.5.0 brings many notable improvements and new features. We have completed a major rework of the GUI: We now support Unicode characters everywhere. The GUI also adapts to high resolutions used in HiDPI screens. The Nintendo DS port has been significantly rewritten. We added GOG and Steam achievements to a large number of Wintermute games and enabled KeyMapper in more games. Thanks to the work of one of our GSoC students, we have now added an option for text-to-speech to the games _Sfinx_,  _Soltys_ and _The Griffon Legend_.\n\nYou may find all of this goodness available to a number of platforms on [our downloads page](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/), or let the autoupdater kick in on Macintosh and Windows.\n\nWe wish you great adventuring, happy puzzle-solving and exciting journeys to RPG worlds, and hope to see you around in the coming years.\n\nAnd by the way, GOG.com is running [a special promo](https://www.gog.com/news/special_event_bscummvm_20th_anniversaryb?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d) tied to the release and our anniversary, where you can buy many ScummVM-supported games at a discount."

        "content": "Starting today, the latest development versions of ScummVM support the new trend that gamers can't stop talking about: NFTs (non-fungible tokens)! This exciting new development, created exclusively for players and backed by blockchain technology, uniquely identifies your in-game items, creating an ever-greater connection between you and the game worlds you love. It's not just *a* rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle, it's *your* rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle.\n\nBut having exclusive ownership to an in-game item is just the beginning! Our developers are exploring how NFTs will let you transfer items between different game inventories. Love your new chainsaw from *Full Throttle*? With the power of NFTs, you can transfer it to *The Secret of Monkey Island* and create some alternate puzzle solutions!\n\nAren’t NFTs energy inefficient? Not for us! NFTs in modern games are less environmentally friendly because they represent in-game items with thousands or millions of pixels. But in the retro games that ScummVM supports, items are only *tens* of pixels, meaning they are less taxing on the environment.\n\nAnd of course, you will be able to buy and sell your valuable NFTs through [ScummVMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion Virtual Machine Marketplace)](https://opensea.io/collection/scummvm). This will allow you trade real-world currency for NFTs and loot boxes containing cosmetic outfits and hats. The profit will help fund “developer retreats” on tropical islands and our plan to launch a *Sam & Max* DeSoto into space.\n\n**Update:** We’ve been blown away by the incredible reaction to this post! However, recent legal challenges to NFTs in the Kingdom of Daventry have led us to explore other methods that will be available to our users in that country.\n\nWe’ve also realized that tropical vacations and space payloads are more expensive than we expected, so we’ve canceled those plans. However, you can help ScummVM with web hosting expenses by donating through PayPal or buying games on GOG.com [through our affiliate link](https://www.gog.com/?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d)."

His effort will help us to allow support for many 90s-era adventure games made with the Macromedia Director authoring tools.

The game (released in 1990) can be described as a mix of genres involving RPG elements with action and puzzles. Many changes across different game variants (written in pure assembly code!) will make this an interesting challenge. This project is a continuation of a GSoC task initially started by a former student back in 2018.\n\n* Emanuele Grisenti (aka [grisenti](https://blogs.scummvm.org/grisenti/)) will be working on a new engine, _HPL1_. The original sources for this engine got recently released by the original developer _Frictional Games_ under GPLv3. The purpose of this project is to achieve a full port of this engine to ScummVM, with the goal of supporting the 2007 survival game _Penumbra: Overture_.\n\n* Avijeet Maurya (aka [StableSteady](https://blogs.scummvm.org/stablesteady/)) will pick up several incomplete engines: MacVenture, Avalanche, Glk-Scott, Pink and WAGE. Some of these engines are very close to completion, but not quite there yet. The main objective of Avijeet's task is to identify all missing features and fix existing bugs. The goal for his project is to bring the above engines to a stable state.\n\nThe team is very excited about the upcoming weeks – and we hope you are as well.\n\nPlease give a warm welcome to our new students!

This effectively should resolve a long-standing issue with modern Android devices, in particular those running Android 11 and above, whereby users could not properly access the game data folders or the save game files in the external storage.\n\nNote that, since this change is a significant one, and one where transition cannot be automated for the end user, you will need to perform a few manual steps to update the paths of your ScummVM-added games with the new access system or to successfully add a new game for which the data files reside on the external storage, eg. on an SD Card. These steps should also appear in a pop-up when launching the new version of ScummVM app, if your device supports SAF. See our [documentation page](https://docs.scummvm.org/en/latest/other_platforms/android.html#adding-saf-paths-to-scummvm-directory-list) for a more detailed description of the process.\n\nSecond, our Android app now features improved key-mapping support for joysticks and modern game controllers and also allows to set the game control method per game entry or globally, per context (ScummVM UI menu, 3d engine game, 2d engine game) providing a choice between \"touchpad emulation\", \"direct mouse\" and \"gamepad emulation\" control.\n\n* During the beta phase we are interested in:\n* Severe bugs or regressions\n* Feedback on the new features\n* Suggestions for improving related instructions and documentation\n\nIf you'd like to participate in the beta testing, please follow the short instructions in [this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.scummvm.scummvm).\n\nAny issues encountered should be reported on [our bug tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org).
