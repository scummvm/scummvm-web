And we are proud to announce two of such newly supported games right away!</p><p>The first one is the FMV-tastic detective mystery <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/urban-runner\">Urban Runner</a>: You are the investigative reporter Max who's being hunted for a murder he didn't commit by both the police and the actual killers. Can you escape your hunters and solve the crime?</p><p>The second one is an obscure interactive storybook for children of the Playtoons series: <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Playtoons_Limited_Edition_-_Bambou_le_Sauveur_de_la_Jungle\">Bambou le Sauveur de la Jungle</a>.
