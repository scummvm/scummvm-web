We talked to John about our plan after a few tequilas and he was immediately on board.</p><p>John's experience will be invaluable in helping us achieve our goal.</p><p>Here is <a href=\"/data/news/20160401.jpg\">screenshot</a> of John's early work with Monkey Island - notice the improved combat system and the subtle tweaks to Captain Smirk's sprite, you'll see why we are so excited.</p><p>So please join us in welcoming John!</p><p><b>UPDATE:</b> No, not really. This was a joke.</p>",
