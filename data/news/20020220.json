    "content": "Travis Howell is making daily snapshots of ScummVM for Windows available for download. Kudos go out to Travis. Also, there is a link for a Windows SDL version of ScummVM. This version does not require the Cygwin dll.<br /> We have also placed a Compatibility Page online to help answer the most common question, \"Which games work?\". We will keep this page updated as development continues.",
