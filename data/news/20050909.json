Thanks a lot to you, our fellow users, who took part in this saga. There are too many of you to mention, but you know who you are.</p><p>We also need to test another couple of newly supported games. These are Maniac Mansion NES version and Zak McKracken Commodore 64. See sections 3.8 and 3.9 in our README on how to run these. We need to know whether these games are completable or not.</p>",
