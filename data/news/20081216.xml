	Henry Stauf cordially invites you to come and sample the delights of
his house in the newest game to be supported by ScummVM,  <i>The 7th
Guest</i>. A delightful evening is guaranteed to be had by you and the
other guests.
	</p>

	<p>
	You will need a copy of the game (DOS and Windows versions only, for
now), and a newly-downloaded <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#SVN">daily build</a> of  
ScummVM. And, of course, your wits about you.
	</p>

	<p>
	Please report any unwanted annoyances (i.e. bugs) to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418820&amp;group_id=37116&amp;func=browse">ScummVM  
bug tracker</a>. If you find any particularly beautiful sights while
you're there, be sure to submit them as <a
href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots">screenshots</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	<i>P.S.</i> There are some slight complications involved in copying the game to
the hard drive, due to there being audio tracks on both CDs. The
information on how to get round this is on the <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/The_7th_Guest">7th Guest wiki  
page</a>, as well as a few known issues, so be sure to read it fully.
