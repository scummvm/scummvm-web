    "content": "<p>Greetings, fellow adventure gamers! We have finally come to the point when ScummVM 1.6.0 testing starts.</p><p>This release adds support for a number of new games that need to be tested:</p><ul><li><i>3 Skulls of the Toltecs</i></li><li><i>Eye of the Beholder</i></li><li><i>Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon</i></li><li><i>Hopkins FBI</i></li><li><i>Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths</i></li><li><i>The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime</i></li></ul><p>In addition, if you have Macintosh version of <i>Discworld</i>, please give it a try as well.</p><p>A <a href=\"/downloads/#daily\">daily build</a> should be used for testing these, and if something goes unexpectedly wrong, please report it to our <a href=\"http://bugs.scummvm.org/\">bug tracker</a>. The completed games need to be reported on <a href=\"http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=12392\">our forums</a> and we will update our <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.6.0\">release testing page</a>. For a usable test report, we need you to provide the version, language, and platform of the game you're testing. And, of course, please stick to the <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing\">testing guidelines</a>.</p><p>This release also has another interesting aspect. Depending on how intensively games are tested, we will add support for one more game: <i>Hopkins FBI</i>. For support to happen, we need test results on several platforms using several variants of the game, which includes the BeOS, OS/2, Linux and Windows versions.</p><p>In conclusion, if you want <i>Hopkins FBI</i> in ScummVM 1.6.0, grab your originals and contribute to this new testing period! We are also in need of screenshots too! Please submit them to <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=37116&amp;atid=418822\">our patch tracker</a>.</p>",
