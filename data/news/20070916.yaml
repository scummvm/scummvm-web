We are glad to announce another supported title: [*I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream*](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/I_Have_No_Mouth%2C_and_I_Must_Scream), which uses the [SAGA](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SAGA) engine.

Help Gorrister, Ellen, Benny, Nimdok and Ted to overcome their fatal flaws and fight the crazed super computer AM.

Get the latest [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM and your English, German, French, Spanish or Russian version of the game and fight the evil super computer! We ask you, our fellow users, to report any bugs you find in our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/), following the [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs).
