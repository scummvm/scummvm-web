A couple of days ago, Google announced the organizations that have been accepted for Google Summer of Code 2019. We are very pleased to announce that ScummVM is one of them, together with our sister project ResidualVM. The Summer of Code is a yearly event organized by Google to encourage students to contribute to open source projects. Open source organizations provide mentors and projects to work on, while Google give some money to participating students. You can find more information on the [official web site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com). We also have some information on [our wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code), and in particular [project rules](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/Project_Rules) that applicants will need to follow.

Are you ready for a great adventure? Do you want to contribute to one of the largest game preservation projects known to mankind? Then ScummVM and ResidualVM are waiting for you! Have a look at [our ideas page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2019). Of course, you are also very welcome to bring your own idea! Students have until April 9 to write and submit proposals for the project they want to work on. The accepted proposals will be announced on May 6, and there will be a few weeks for community bonding before the start of the coding period on May 27.

In any case, don't hesitate to chat with us on IRC! #scummvm and #residualvm in the Freenode network are the place to go!
