    "content": "<p>It has been longer than usual since the last release. Nevertheless the team is happy to announce the release of ScummVM 1.3.0.</p><p>The release is truly feature-rich: in particular we are introducing support for a new platform, WebOS, and adding a set of new games: <i>Urban Runner</i>, <i>Playtoons</i>, <i>Toonstruck</i>, <i>Hugo</i> series, <i>Living Books</i>, <i>Backyard Baseball</i>. We have also continued to work hard on the SCI engine, so Amiga and some Macintosh versions of the games are supported now too. Many of our ports received improvements, and a number of bugs have been fixed in practically every engine. Thus your gameplay should be smoother and more enjoyable.</p><p>As usual, the release can be found on our <a href=\"/downloads/\">downloads page</a> and <a href=\"/frs/scummvm/1.3.0/ReleaseNotes\">full release notes</a> are also available.</p>",
