Hence, we ask you to catch up with the Bargonians and hunt for bugs along the way.</p><p>The procedure is the same as the last few times: take your copy of Bargon Attack and a <a href=\"/downloads/#daily\">daily build</a> of ScummVM. Be sure you read the <a href=\"/faq/#question.report-bugs\">bug submission guidelines</a> and enter any bugs into <a href=\"http://bugs.scummvm.org/\">our bug tracker</a>.</p><p>Some screenshots would be nice, too.</p><p>Oh, and check out Ender's speech at LCA2007 <a href=\"http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2007/video/tuesday/tuesday_1650_gaming.ogg\">here</a>.</p>",
