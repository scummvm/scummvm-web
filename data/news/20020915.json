But I'm going to try and throw a party anyway. So everyone is invited to attend my IRC channel, #scummvm, on irc.freenode.net! <br /><br /> If your someone like famous, or you like me, or whatever, and you want to pop in and say 'Hi!' to me and my <a href=\"http://www.scummvm.org/contact.php\">parents</a>... come on by! Or if you just want to send me a birthday card, or RSVP for the party, go over to the Contact page and e-mail Endy or someone. Or post in my new shiny <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=210596\">Birthday Forum</a>. We should be around pretty much all day. <br /><br /> If you want to actually meet a ScummVM developer in real life, and buy him (I don't have a mummy! Wahh!) a beer or something.... you can always drop a post in the <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=210596\">Birthday Forum</a> and see if theres anyone else in your area. I'm sure they would appretiate it! <br /><br /> Oh, and I lost a small, fleece sweater with three blue roses on it. If you see it, please commit it to CVS for me!<br />",
