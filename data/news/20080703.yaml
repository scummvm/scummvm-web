The finalists for the [SourceForge.net 2008 Community Choice Awards](https://sourceforge.net/community/cca08/) have been announced. ScummVM is proud [to be nominated](https://sourceforge.net/community/cca08-finalists) once again for best project in the "Best Project for Gamers" category (also in another one which we don't care that much if we win ;-) ).

Thanks to all our users who voted for us in the preliminaries. You have to vote for your favorite project one more time (hint: starts with "S", ends with "VM") to select the best of the best in SourceForge.net. So head on to the [voting place](https://sourceforge.net/community/cca08/) and vote with your SourceForge.net username.
