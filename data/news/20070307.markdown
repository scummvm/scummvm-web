[*Bargon Attack*](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Bargon_Attack), which like *Ween: The Prophecy* shares most of the code with *Gobliins 2*, is now completable and supported. Hence, we ask you to catch up with the Bargonians and hunt for bugs along the way.

The procedure is the same as the last few times: take your copy of Bargon Attack and a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM. Be sure you read the [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs) and enter any bugs into [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/).

Some screenshots would be nice, too.

Oh, and check out Ender's speech at LCA2007 [here](http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2007/video/tuesday/tuesday_1650_gaming.ogg).
