Right after the ending of [Myst](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Myst), you are promptly sent to another Age by Atrus, where his wife Catherine is stranded. Riven is the fifth Age written by Atrus' father, Gehn, which he rules as a cruel self-proclaimed god. Your dual mission is to rescue Catherine and imprison Gehn. To be successful you will have to carefully explore the five islands of Riven and solve the intricate puzzles they hide.

The ScummVM team is proud to announce that [Riven: The Sequel to Myst](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Riven:_The_Sequel_to_Myst) is finally ready for its testing period. If you want to help with the tests, use the latest [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM to play the Windows or Mac version of the game. Please report the issues you encounter on our [bug tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/). Be sure to follow our [testing and bug reporting guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing).

As a warm up before playing Riven, you may want to play Myst. If you do so, please use a daily build of ScummVM. Major changes were made to the game engine to remove situations where the game feels unresponsive. Some bugs may have escaped our attention. As with Riven, please report the issues you notice during your play-through.
