We announced 6 weeks ago that Google accepted ScummVM for the Google Summer of Code this year again.

This week Google revealed 4 students will work with us this summer!

In order to tease you a bit, here is a short introduction:

*   *RichieSams* will work on integrating Marisa Chan's Z-Engine, which concerns Zork Nemesis and Zork Grand Inquisitor.
*   *Rundfunk* will focus on GUI extensions and improvements, with particular care for touchscreen devices.
*   *Uruk* will port the Avalanche engine from Pascal to C++. This is to support the game Lord Avalot d'Argent.
*   *T0by* will work on our Wintermute engine to fix several issues and add a number of features not present in WME Light

We'd like you to join us and warmly welcome those four students and wish them all the best for the next 3 months.

We also are really grateful to Google for giving us the opportunity to mentor students this year and benefit from their passion.

Stay tuned!
