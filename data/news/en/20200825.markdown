ScummVM Team is proud to announce support for a small freeware RPG game named <i>The Griffon Legend</i>. It was [originally](http://syn9.thehideoutgames.com/index_backup.php) written in the FreeBASIC programming language by Daniel "Syn9" Kennedy and later ported by  Dmitry Smagin to the GCW0 console, which we base this port on.

The original story says:

>500 years after the Griffon-Dragon war, the Dragons have
returned to reclaim their empire. Cities are falling,
everyone is dieing, and the lone Griffon Knight Fayne is
caught up in the middle of it all.

Since the game is freeware, you may grab a copy directly from our game [downloads page](https://www.scummvm.org/games/) or from the [original site](http://syn9.thehideoutgames.com/index_backup.php?table=griffonlegend). You will need the latest [development build](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html) to play it. Of course, if you encounter any bugs, please submit them to [our bug tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
