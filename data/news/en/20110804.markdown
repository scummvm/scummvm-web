No, it's not Tolkien's Ring, it's the Ringworld. Join Quinn, Miranda, and Seeker-of-Vengeance as they seek to unravel the mysteries of the Ringworld and find a way to stop the insane Kzinti Patriarch.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce support for [Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch](http://www.mobygames.com/game/ringworld-revenge-of-the-patriarch). So grab your copy of the DOS Floppy or CD (original CD release/First Wave re-release), start playing in the [latest daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM, and help us with the testing while enjoying this classic science fiction adventure.

Of course, all bugs should be reported to [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). For further information, check out the [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs).

Good luck finding the elusive stasis boxes.
