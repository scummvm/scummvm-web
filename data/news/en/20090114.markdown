The developers of ScummVM are pleased to announce that as of today, the classic game Discworld has full support for [James Woodcock's Music Enhancement Project](http://www.jameswoodcock.co.uk/?page_id=54) within the developers build.  The project started way back in January 2006 as [James Woodcock](http://www.jameswoodcock.co.uk) committed himself to use the original MIDI files from various Point and Click Adventure titles, creating enhanced versions using modern MIDI equipment.  He has already released the [Simon the Sorcerer](http://www.jameswoodcock.co.uk/?p=956) version and can now add Discworld to his completion list:

*"I have tried very hard to remain faithful to the originals in respect to the excellent composers creations..."* says James Woodcock, creator of the ScummVM Music Enhancement Project.  He continues *"...There has been a lot of support and interest from Discworld fans, who have been monitoring its progress very carefully and it is with great pleasure I can finally play Discworld using new versions of the original soundtrack with many thanks to the developers of ScummVM for all their hard work in making this feature possible".*

James uses the [Yamaha Tyros2 keyboard](http://www.yamahapkowner.com/?page_id=93) hooked up to his computer via USB and after going through various tweaking, recording and editing, a finalised music track is born. 

With permission from legendary author [Terry Pratchett](http://www.jameswoodcock.co.uk/?p=796) himself, the Discworld enhanced soundtrack (version 2.0) will be released in full and compatible with ScummVM in the future when hopefully we expect the freeware version of the game will be made available to the public to enjoy all over again.
