We are pleased to announce the release of ScummVM 0.7.1. This update concentrates on fixing bugs from 0.7.0, especially in the Windows Mobile port (PocketPC / Smartphone). For more information check out the [release notes](/frs/scummvm/0.7.1/ReleaseNotes).

As usual, you can download it from our [downloads page](/downloads/).

On an unrelated side note, we received even more [boot params](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Boot_Params) from you, our dear users, in the past two weeks. Many thanks to those who contributed!
