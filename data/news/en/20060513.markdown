Many of you have been waiting for this for a while, but we're proud to present our new-look [ScummVM Forums](http://forums.scummvm.org)!

We would like to personally thank [Clem](http://www.unet.univie.ac.at/~a0200586/) for designing and implementing the new theme, and Raina for creating the buttons and icons. After much work and effort, the results speak for themselves.

If you have any feedback or suggestions on the new design, please post in the [feedback thread](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?p=8561).
