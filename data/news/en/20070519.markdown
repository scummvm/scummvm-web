Hello there ScummVM users! It's that time of year again where we ask you to test your games while we gear up for a new release, and this time it's for 0.10.0. While the official Big Testing Season(TM) begins on May 23, we ask that you begin testing games now, except for AGOS games (*Simon the Sorcerer* series, *Feeble Files*) and *Nippon Safes*.

There are several new games for 0.10.0 including *Touche: The Adventure of the Fifth Musketeer* and *Future Wars*. In addition, DrMcCoy has been extra busy and dealt us *Gobliins 2*, *Goblins 3*, *Ween: The Prophecy* and *Bargon Attack*. Also, *Nippon Safes* will be included in this release. This release will also feature the AGI games from the merge with Sarien.

There are detailed instructions on how to perform testing in a helpful way. You will find them at our [Wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing). Please, stick to those and report on our mailing list, on #scummvm or in [our forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?p=22358). The current list of tested games can be found [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/0.10.0).
