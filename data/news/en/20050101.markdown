First off: once more a Happy New Year to all of you out there!

We just wanted to let you know that since the release of ScummVM 0.7.0 a week ago, a few more binaries have arrived at your [download page](/downloads/). We now offer binaries for the following systems:

*   Windows
*   Mac OS X
*   Linux: Fedora Core
*   Solaris 8
*   PalmOS
*   PocketPC (WinCE)
*   Dreamcast
*   BeOS

... and hopefully the Debian package will be ready soon.

That's already quite nice, but more never hurts. For example, it would be nice to have packages for Mandrake, Slackware, Solaris x86, or your favorite toaster. So if you are interested in joining us as a packager, please [contact us](http://www.scummvm.org/contact.php).

And now for something completely different: Taking a look at our [project statistics page](https://sourceforge.net/project/stats/index.php?report=last_30&group_id=37116), you might notice that we have now more than 10,000,000 page views (accumulated over the total life time of ScummVM as a SourceForge.net project), and have served more than 1.1 million downloads since our conception. Not too shabby, we think :-)
