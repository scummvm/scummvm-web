Rejoice, ScummVM 0.8.1 "Codename: missing" has just been released. You can now experience the latest official flavour of ScummVM. The main reason for this release is fixing several bugs that slipped into 0.8.0, some of these fixes are:

*   Much improved support for Humongous Entertainment games
*   Support the German version of Maniac Mansion NES (thanks to Joachim Eberhard for contributing the cartridge)
*   Fixed overflow when using control panel for the robot in the Dig
*   Fixed disappearing cursor when level password is typed in Gobliiins
*   Implemented more precise MD5-based game detection for Simon the Sorcerer
*   First non-beta PS2 port release

For a complete list of changes see the [release notes](/frs/scummvm/0.8.1/ReleaseNotes).

You can grab a build for your system on our [downloads page](/downloads/)

Enjoy!
