The first binary release of the PlayStation 2 Port has now been posted to our forums in [this thread](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=206). It was not added to the download pages as it still needs some testing. If you've got a PlayStation 2 with a modchip, grab it and tell us about your results.
