ScummVM now adds another freeware title to its list of games: [*Lure of the Temptress*](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Lure_of_the_Temptress), which was the first game to use Revolution Software's Virtual Theatre engine. Players must help Diermot escape imprisonment, unravel the mysteries surrounding the Skorl occupation of the town, and eventually defeat the evil enchantress that controls them.

Get the latest [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM and the required [support data file](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/raw/master/dists/engine-data/lure.dat). Since the game is freeware, you can freely download it in any of the available languages: [English](/frs/extras/Lure%20of%20the%20Temptress/lure-1.0.zip), [French](/frs/extras/Lure%20of%20the%20Temptress/lure-fr-1.0.zip), [German](/frs/extras/Lure%20of%20the%20Temptress/lure-de-1.0.zip), [Italian](/frs/extras/Lure%20of%20the%20Temptress/lure-it-1.0.zip), and [Spanish](/frs/extras/Lure%20of%20the%20Temptress/lure-es-1.0.zip). You can also pick up several versions of the game directly from the [Revolution website](http://www.revolution.co.uk/_display.php?id=10).

Please post any bugs you can find to our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/), following the [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs). Screenshots are also needed, which can be submitted using the appropriate [guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) for screenshot submission.

We are also currently looking for anyone who may have knowledge of a Dutch release of the game and can provide us with a copy.
