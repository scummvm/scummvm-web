The ScummVM team is announcing another round of release testing in preparation for our next release: 1.3.0!

Since our last release, we've been very busy working on adding support for more of your favorite games. *Backyard Baseball*. *Backyard Baseball 2001*, *Hugo's House of Horrors*, *Hugo 2: Whodunit?*, *Hugo 3: Jungle of Doom*, *Playtoons: Bambou le Sauveur de la Jungle*, *Toonstruck*, and *Urban Runner* are all ready for our loyal fans to play through to their hearts' content. Several Living Books games are also supported now: *Aesop's Fables: The Tortoise and the Hare*, *Arthur's Birthday* (v1), *Arthur's Teacher Trouble*, *Dr. Seuss's ABC*, *Green Eggs and Ham*, *Harry and the Haunted House*, *Just Grandma and Me* (v1), *Little Monster at School*, *Ruff's Bone*, *Sheila Rae, the Brave*, *Stellaluna*, *The Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight*, *The Berenstain Bears in the Dark*, *The New Kid on the Block*. You can see more info on the bugs we fixed and the features we added over [here](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/raw/master/NEWS).

Like with our last release testing, not all games will be tested; only games that have had significant changes to their codebase since the last release are up for testing. As usual, the list of games to be tested is on the [wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.3.0).

Those games aren't going to test themselves! Download a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) and report any bugs you find to the [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). If you complete a game, please let us know on [the forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=10173) so we can throw the results up on the [wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.3.0). Be sure to provide the version, language, and platform of your game when reporting a completion. Any other questions? Go check out the [release testing guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing).
