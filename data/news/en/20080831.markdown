We can call it a tremendous development. Half a year since 0.11.1 passed pretty quickly, and we are pleased to announce the release of 0.12.0!

This new version of ScummVM adds support for 5 completely new games. The games that now run smoothly on many more platforms than was initially intended are: *The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Two: Hand of Fate*, *The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Three: Malcolm's Revenge*, *Lost in Time*, *The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble* and *Drascula: The Vampire Strikes Back*.

The number of supported platforms grew as well. The **PS2** port has been revived, and the **GameCube** and **Wii** are now supported too. Take your Wiimote and make your beloved adventure game protagonist run around the screen :).

No need to go any further into details here, those who want to know the gory details can always refer to [the release notes](/frs/scummvm/0.12.0/ReleaseNotes), and all of you are invited to go to [our downloads page](/downloads/).

P.S. *Soon, pretty soon, look out for more news from us.*
