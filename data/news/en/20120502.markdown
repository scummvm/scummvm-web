Water, water, every where, nor any drop to drink...

Euh... No, not this nightmare: you're Ryan, a bartender who can't sleep peacefully for months because of weird dreams and nightmares. During one of those, a monk suggests you become the deliverer who would keep the Dreamweb safe by killing its enemies.

The ScummVM Team is proud to announce that [Dreamweb](http://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamweb) is now playable in ScummVM using the latest [daily builds](/downloads/#daily), and ready for testing.

Please post any bugs you find in the [bugtracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/), following our [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs). Any [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) of your playthrough is welcome.
