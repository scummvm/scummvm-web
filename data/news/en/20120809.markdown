As part of the [ScummVM Music Enhancement Project](http://www.jameswoodcock.co.uk/content/scummvm-music-enhancement-project/), James has released version 1.0 of his enhanced soundtrack for The 7th Guest.  
  
The 7th Guest is James' 5th enhanced soundtrack released so far with another on the horizon. The project enables users of ScummVM who own the original game the ability to experience game MIDI music through high quality modern equipment without any of the cost, which has been in this case edited and recorded on James' Tyros4 keyboard, currently Yamaha's flagship model.  
  
*"The 7th Guest revolutionised the way in which we experience video games and the soundtrack originally created by The Fat Man added to the overall atmosphere and splendour"* commented James Woodcock, creator of the ScummVM Music Enhancement Project. James continued *"With the wonderful soundtrack originally in MIDI format, it was an obvious title to target for enhancement and I appreciated that Trilobyte Games gave their blessing"*.  
  
James has already released enhanced soundtracks for Simon the Sorcerer, Discworld, Inherit the Earth and more recently Beneath A Steel Sky.
