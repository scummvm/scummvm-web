You're a pizza delivery boy and you're in trouble. Now it is your goal to stop Dick Tate, before the whole world is filled with his evil clones!

Now you can follow this funny story with ScummVM. We recently added support for *Bud Tucker in Double Trouble* and as usual you're encouraged to playtest it with a [daily build](/downloads/#daily), [report](/faq/#question.report-bugs) all encountered bugs to our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) and [submit some nice screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).
