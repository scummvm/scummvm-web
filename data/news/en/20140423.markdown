The accepted Google Summer of Code proposals have been announced yesterday, and we are pleased to say that ScummVM will be mentoring two students, for projects with a Polish theme.

*   Peter Bozsσ (a.k.a. uruk), who you may remember from last year, will work on an engine (and translation to English) of the Polish game ***Sfinx***.
*   Lukasz Watka (a.k.a. lukaslw) will work on an engine (and translation to English) of the Polish game ***The Prince and the Coward***.

Additionally, ScummVM is acting as an umbrella organisation during GSoC for our sister project ResidualVM. They will be mentoring three students:

*   Stefano Musumeci (a.k.a. subr3v) will be working on refactoring and optimizing the ***TinyGL software renderer***.
*   Joni Vδhδmδki (a.k.a. Akz) and Joseph Jezak (a.k.a. JoseJX) will both be working on improving the ***Escape from Monkey Island*** engine, tackling bugs and missing features from two different angles.

We expect it will be a productive and interesting summer!
