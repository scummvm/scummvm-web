Continuing our incredible pace of one announcement per month, we're proud to be able to ask you to grab your copies of [Hugo's trilogy](http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/hugo-series) (DOS or Windows version) and try them out in ScummVM using the [latest daily build](/downloads/#daily).

The games supported (Hugo's House of Horror, Hugo 2: Whodunit? and Hugo 3: Jungle of Doom) are still available for sale on the [author's site](http://www.dgray.com/hwpage.htm). So buy them if you don't own them, copy the [required data files](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Hugo.27s_House_of_Horrors) and give them a try!

Don't hesitate to report any bugs you find in the [bugtracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/), following our bug submission [guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs). [Screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots#How_to_make_screenshots) are welcome too, as usual!
