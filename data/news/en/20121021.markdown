Thanks to the generosity of Creative Reality and Neil Dodwell, the ScummVM team is happy to announce the freeware release of *Dreamweb*.

This game was originally released in 1994 and is set in a cyberpunk dystopian city where a bartender named Ryan has been having some disturbing dreams...

You can find the freeware release for English, French and Spanish on our [downloads page](/downloads/).

The ScummVM team would like to make it clear that this game was given a (15) certification at release as it features a disturbing story and violence, and is thus **not suitable for children**.

If you happen to own an original version not yet available on our download page, please [contact us](mailto:lechuck@scummvm.org) so we can work on making it free too!
