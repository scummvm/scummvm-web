This year, Google announced the largest Summer of Code ever, with 201 accepted organizations. We are very pleased to announce we are participating this year again, together with our sister project ResidualVM.

Are you a motivated student? Do you want to participate in the largest Google Summer of Code ever? Do you want to be known as a contributor to one of the largest game preservation projects?

Then ScummVM and ResidualVM are waiting for you! Have a look at [our ideas page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2017) or bring your own idea!

In any case, don't hesitate to chat with us on IRC! One place: Freenode. Two channels: #scummvm and #residualvm
