Some interesting news for you. Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. has released the ITE Soundtrack on CD. You may listen to a preview and buy it from [here](http://www.wyrmkeep.com/ite/music.html). ScummVM supports this game as of 0.8.0, thanks to our tight collaboration with Wyrmkeep and the fact that they kindly provided us with all source code and the rights to reimplement it. Support this great company by purchasing the game soundtrack and, of course, the game itself, which you can play using ScummVM.
