Rex Nebular, God's gift to the galaxy, has been stranded on a planet where he was attempting to locate to retrieve a valuable vase. To escape, he'll have to use the infamous Gender Bender to get in touch with his female side and successfully locate both the vase and a way to escape the planet.

The ScummVM Team is proud to announce support for [*Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Nebular_and_the_Cosmic_Gender_Bender), the first MADS game written by Microprose. It is now playable in ScummVM using the latest [daily builds](/downloads/#daily) and ready for testing. As usual, all bugs should be reported to [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) following our [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs). While you play through the game, we would also love it if you could take some [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) for us.

So, dust off your copy and try it out. If you don't already own the game, it can be purchased online at [GOG.com](http://www.gog.com/game/rex_nebular_and_the_cosmic_gender_bender?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d).
