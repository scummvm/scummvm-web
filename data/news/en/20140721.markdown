A year has passed and ScummVM 1.7.0 is here.

With this release we have added support for 5 completely new games. These are:

*   *The Neverhood*
*   *Mortville Manor*
*   *Voyeur*
*   *Return to Ringworld*
*   *Chivalry is Not Dead*

Also, we have updated the MT-32 emulator, added an OpenGL backend, improved many aspects of the GUI, enhanced the AGOS engine, made *Urban Runner*'s videos less CPU-demanding, fixed tons of bugs in dozens of SCI games, improved sound in *Loom* and *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* and improved platform portability for the Tony and Tinsel engines.

But this is not all. We have added experimental support for the OUYA console (we couldn't add GCW-Zero support simply because sev *still* awaits his console from [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gcw/gcw-zero-open-source-gaming-handheld/posts)), made major improvements to the PS2 port and merged the Bada with Tizen ports.

The full list with all changes mentioned can be found in [our release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.7.0/ReleaseNotes) and the release can be obtained as usual from our [downloads page](/downloads/).

Everybody Way Oh!
