Today, we have some awesome news to share. As you might have heard, Cyan, Inc. — the makers of Myst and Riven — are [re-releasing the entire Myst series to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the original Myst game](https://myst.com). And ScummVM and ResidualVM take part in this celebration in a special way!

**Myst — Masterpiece Edition** and **Riven — The Sequel to Myst** are powered by ScummVM, while **Myst III — Exile** is driven by ResidualVM.

In order to achieve the best possible gaming experience and to make your journey through the Ages even more pleasant, Cyan and ScummVM are establishing a new partnership, with both teams working together as closely as possible in the future!

Perhaps the ending has not yet been written — more news will follow soon!
