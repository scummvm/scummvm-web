The Neverhood needs you! Klaymen, our hero, wakes up in a building in the strangely empty world of Neverhood. It's up to you to explore and find out what happened to Neverhood's wacky clay world.

The ScummVM Team is proud to announce that [The Neverhood](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/neverhood) is now playable in ScummVM using the latest [daily builds](/downloads/#daily), and ready for testing. As usual, all bugs should be reported to [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) following our [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs). While you play through the game, we would also love it if you could take some [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) for us.
