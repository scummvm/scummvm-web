ScummVM continues to leap forward in a leap year, and we are pleased to announce the next shiny bugfix release of the project.

As usual, it holds a number of improvements, it's more stable, and it should bring you even more fun than 0.11.0.

We fixed the digital iMUSE system (better *COMI* experience), *King's Quest 4* bugs were squashed, and support for fanmade AGI games has been improved; *Lure of the Temptress*, *Inherit the Earth* and *I Have no Mouth* all work better since we fixed several crashes, lock-ups and all such buzzwords.

As a special bonus we are glad to announce the return of the **BeOS** port and the deeply missed **Playstation 2** port.

For a more comprehensive list of improvements you are welcome to visit [the release notes](/frs/scummvm/0.11.1/ReleaseNotes), but for those demanding to play, the latest and greatest version of ScummVM waits for you right on [our downloads page](/downloads/)!
