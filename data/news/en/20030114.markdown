If you're a Linux user, Happy Penguin are running a [series of polls](http://happypenguin.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=17) to determine the best games in a ton of categories. Go vote for your favourite emulators, what you think the most promising project is, et cetera... Hopefully some of those votes might even be for us :)
