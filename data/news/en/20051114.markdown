As you can read [here](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=236), we (joostp and lavosspawn) have the ambition to create an audibly improved version of BASS by using the high quality studio source material, which is stored on DATs (Digital Audio Tape).

At this point we have these DATs in our possession and are looking for help in getting the audio off them. Since we're not in the position to send the tapes anywhere, we're looking for someone to lend us a DAT player/recorder for about 2 weeks to complete this first step. The DAT player would need to be shipped to the Netherlands, and will be returned upon completion of the task.

If you think you can help out, please get in touch! For more information, see the [forum thread](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=236).
