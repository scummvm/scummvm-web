You're Doralice, the cutest airline captain of the Paris-Miami flight. During your last trip, a dying passenger asked you to deliver top secret vials. Will you succeed in your mission, avoiding deadly traps and solving every mystery?

Currently, the PC versions of [Fascination](http://www.mobygames.com/game/fascination) are missing an AdLib player, but everything else is there. Please note that the CD version requires some manipulations and the ScummVM tools to extract the [required files](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Fascination).

Get the latest [daily build of ScummVM](/downloads/#daily) and your version of the game and give Fascination a try! Please post any bugs and unrecognized versions you can find to our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/), following the [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs).

And if you find interesting sights, be sure to submit your [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).
