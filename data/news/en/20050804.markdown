Due to a local space/time vortex which will in the future be located near Earth, the meaning of 'regularly' may be in flux. Stay tuned for further updates.

And now, to current news:

We're happy to report that Ron Gilbert, co-creator of Maniac Mansion and SCUMM, made a nice reference to ScummVM on his website ([Grumpy Gamer](http://grumpygamer.com/). Or so we hear from [Slashdot](http://games.slashdot.org/games/05/08/03/1641224.shtml?tid=207&tid=202&tid=203), which seems to have brought his site to its knees :)

Please note, however, that the Nintendo DS port mentioned is not yet an official or supported port. So please don't contact us about it, because we can't help :)

The contents of Rons latest post has been quoted in [this blogspot post](http://humaninbox.blogspot.com/2005/08/ron-gilbert-supports-illegitimate.html). For the record, we've given Ron the nod in our readme.txt since Wed Apr 17 17:31:05 2002 (UTC).

We're also calling for testers to report problems with ['Inherit the Earth'](http://www.wyrmkeep.com/ite/) (details and purchase information behind the link!). Please use the bug tracker, and set the correct game under Group. Please only test with the **latest** CVS version. Thanks!
