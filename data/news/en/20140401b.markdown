**Happy April Fools' Day! Unfortunately, we haven't really got a new developer... though pull requests are welcome!**

We do not normally announce new developers here, but we have an unusual and talented developer recently join the team, Edward Snowden.

When we first got the e-mail from a dot-ru address which we will not be disclosing, we were skeptical.

However upon verifying his PGP key, we are convinced that this is not some kind of April Fools joke and are happy to welcome a talented software developer with enthusiasm to the team.

He is apparently a big fan of point and click adventures, especially *Beneath a Steel Sky,*, *Dreamweb*, *Woodruff and the Schnibble of Azimuth*, and *I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream*. His collection allowed him to pass a long stopover at an airport last year and he decided then, once he had sorted some personal issues to get around to contributing some code to ScummVM.

As an avid fan of Larry Niven, he will be initially working on the TSaGE support for *Return to Ringworld* along with Strangerke, and will be using the nickname "crazyeddie"

Please can we ask the other developers and users not to bother him about any issues outside of ScummVM and not to send any irrelevant e-mails to his ScummVM address at "crazyeddie@scummvm.org" Thanks!
