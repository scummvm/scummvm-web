We are always thrilled to explore new ways to bring our community closer together. Today, we are proud to announce our next step in this journey - we are now present on [Discord!](https://discord.gg/5D8yTtF)

No matter if you just want to hang around with the ScummVM community or to discuss the latest development, this is the (new!) place to go!

See you on Discord!

Please note that despite the introduction of the new Discord server, our Forums and IRC channel on the Freenode network are still available and we have absolutely no plans to disable them in the future.
