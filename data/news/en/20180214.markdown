Two days ago, Google announced the organizations that have been accepted for this year's Summer of Code, and we are very pleased to announce that ScummVM is one of them, together with our sister project ResidualVM. The Summer of Code is a yearly event organized by Google to encourage students to contribute to open source projects. Open source organizations provide mentors and projects to work on, while Google give some money to participating students. You can find more information on the [official web site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com). We also have some information on [our wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code), and in particular [project rules](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/Project_Rules) that applicants will need to follow.

Are you a motivated student? Are you available between May 14 and August 6? Do you want to be a contributor to one of the largest game preservation projects? Then ScummVM and ResidualVM are waiting for you! Have a look at [our ideas page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/GSoC_Ideas_2018) or bring your own idea! Students have until March 27 to write and submit proposals for the project they want to work on. The accepted proposals will be announced on April 23, and there will be a few weeks for community bonding before the start of the 12 week coding period on May 14.

In any case, don't hesitate to chat with us on IRC! One place: Freenode. Two channels: #scummvm and #residualvm
