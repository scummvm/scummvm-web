No, not that force, it's Blue Force. Jake Ryan has just graduated from the Policy Academy, and it's up to you to guide his actions as he starts his police career. He'll quickly become involved in solving a series of crimes which, unbeknownst to him, are inextricably entwined with the murder of his parents when he was a child.

The ScummVM Team is proud to announce that [Blue Force](http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/blue-force) is now playable in ScummVM using the latest [daily builds](/downloads/#daily), and ready for testing. As usual, all bugs should be reported to [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) following our [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs). While you play through the game, we would also love it if you could take some [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) for us.
