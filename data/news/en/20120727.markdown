Little Red Riding Hood looking over at her grandmother's latest install of ScummVM, noting the update to version 1.5.0 and asked "My what a lot of games you now support". "All the better to entertain you with my dear!" responded the curiously grinning relative.

We all love to feast on the most sumptuous of gaming titles and our latest release will fulfil your craving for even more classic point and click adventures.

Version 1.5.0 adds support for *Once Upon A Time: Little Red Riding Hood* and the following titles:

*   *Backyard Baseball 2003*
*   *Blue Force*
*   *Darby the Dragon*
*   *Dreamweb*
*   *Geisha*
*   *Gregory and the Hot Air Balloon*
*   *Magic Tales: Liam Finds a Story*
*   *Sleeping Cub's Test of Courage*
*   *Soltys*

As always, there are many more new features; you can find the full list in [our release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.5.0/ReleaseNotes) and the release itself on our [downloads page](/downloads/).
