Every now and then somebody will raise the subject of finding a 'better' name for ScummVM, one that fits better with it's modern scope (which extends well beyond SCUMM games). So [at this page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/ScummVM_Name) we present you with some nice alternatives. Choose whichever suits you best -- but we will stay ScummVM.

Cheers
