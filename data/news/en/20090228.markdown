As we turned to a 6 months release cycle, [here](/downloads/) is our newest and best ScummVM version for you!

A couple of new engines were added, and besides 2 Humongous Entertainment titles, we now support *The 7th Guest* and *Bud Tucker in Double Trouble*.

Among other notable things there is a completely new vector-based GUI, which is a merged work of our last year GSoC student Vicent Marti, as well as a General Main Menu which adds a common save/load interface to most of our engines, adding the much awaited Return to Launcher feature along the way. It was the work of another successful student, Chris Page.

A complete list of new games and features can be found in the [release notes](/frs/scummvm/0.13.0/ReleaseNotes), and the latest ScummVM version itself (available for a large number of platforms as usual) is located at the [downloads page](/downloads/).

Let's play!
