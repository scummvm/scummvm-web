Greetings fellow Adventurers!  
  
SourceForge, our host, is moving hardware on the 14th and 17th of November. During this time, there will be a number of outages:  

*   14th: ScummVM Downloads and Mailing Lists will be unavailable between approximatly 16:00 Pacific Time (GMT-8), till 19:00.
*   17th: The main ScummVM site, and CVS tree, will be unavailable from 10:00 Pacific. This may last up to 12 hours, but hopefully less!

  
  
Thank you, and please shop at Snuckeys again!
