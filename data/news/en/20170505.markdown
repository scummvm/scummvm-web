Today Google announced the accepted projects for this year's Summer of Code. We are pleased to say that ScummVM will be mentoring two wizard students who will have one mission: casting the Super Sludge Nova spell. Effects include adding support for two new engines, and the cooldown period is 12 weeks:

*   Joseph-Eugene Winzer (a.k.a. Joefish) will be working on adding support for the ***[Mission Supernova](http://outpost.simplicity.de)*** game.
*   Simei Yin will work on porting the ***[Sludge engine](https://opensludge.github.io)*** to ScummVM.

We extend a warm welcome to our students for what we hope will be a productive and interesting summer! You can follow their progress throughout the summer on the [ScummVM Blogs](http://planet.scummvm.org).
