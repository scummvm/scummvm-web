It is time to announce our next Big Testing SeasonTM. This means that pretty soon you, our fellow users, will see the new and shiny ScummVM version.

We have extended the set of our supported games by 8 new (or old :) ) games. The list includes: *I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream*, *Lure of the Temptress*, *Elvira - Mistress of the Dark*, *Elvira II - The Jaws of Cerberus*, *Waxworks* (Amiga version only), and early Sierra preAGI games *Mickey's Space Adventure*, *Troll's Tale*, and *Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood*.

There are detailed instructions on how to perform testing in a helpful way. You will find them on our [Wiki page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing). Please stick to those and report on our mailing list, in #scummvm or on [our forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?p=29716). The current list of tested games can be found [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/0.11.0).
