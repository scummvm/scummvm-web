The year is 1685. The place is Versailles. Somebody has threatened to burn the castle and Alexandre Bontemps, the Premier valet of King Louis XIV, is asking for your help. You have until the end of the day to investigate and save the castle.

The ScummVM team is proud to announce support for Cryo's Versaille 1685 game and needs your help to test the game. Grab your copy of Versailles 1685 (the DOS, Windows, and Macintosh versions are supported), download the [latest development build](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html) of ScummVM, and start exploring the castle and its surroundings. While you do so, please report any bugs you find on our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org) and take [screenshots](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Screenshots) of interesting places.
