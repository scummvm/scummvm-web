We are very happy to announce that our friends at Cyan, Inc. [released their 25th Anniversary Collection of the Myst series today](https://www.gog.com/news/release_myst_iii_exile_myst_iv_revelation?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d) as digital download on GOG.com.

**[Myst — Masterpiece Edition](https://www.gog.com/game/myst_masterpiece_edition?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d)** and **[Riven — The Sequel to Myst](https://www.gog.com/game/riven_the_sequel_to_myst?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d)** are powered by ScummVM, while **[Myst III — Exile](https://www.gog.com/game/myst_3_exile?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d)** is driven by ResidualVM.

In the last couple of weeks, both the Cyan and the ScummVM teams have made great strides to improve game compatibility. Due to intense testing, we have already managed to fix most issues that were present in ScummVM and ResidualVM. However, due to the nature of software development, it's still possible that we missed something, so we need your help now.

While we can fix issues in the GOG.com versions of the games at a later date with a simple update, this won't be possible for the upcoming Collector's Edition on DVDs, so we need to make sure that we have fleshed out any bugs before the DVDs are manufactured.

So, please grab a copy from GOG.com or if you were a backer in the Kickstarter campaign, redeem your code. Visit Myst Island, roam through Age 233, have a nice stay in Releeshahn and report any issue you can find to our [Bug Tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/).

And please... bring me the blue pages!
