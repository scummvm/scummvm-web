The ScummVM team is excited to welcome CadiH and b-gent, our talented technical writers and participants of Googleâ€™s Season of Docs.

CadiH will be working with us to launch a new documentation portal, which will include a revamped user manual and centralize our diaspora of information from the Wiki, Readme, and various other docs within our repository. 

b-gent brings his expertise and experience to help us modernize our Doxygen documentation. The Doxygen portal has long been neglected, this will benefit our developers and community as a whole.

The work will officially begin on September 14 and will last 3 months. You can follow the progress of our two writers on the [ScummVM Blogs](https://planet.scummvm.org) and in the scummvm-gdoc channel on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/5D8yTtF). In the meantime join us in welcoming them to our community.
