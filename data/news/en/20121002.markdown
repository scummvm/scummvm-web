Several years ago, we brought you the English, the German and the Hebrew versions of "**Flight of the Amazon Queen**". Today, thanks to John Passfield and Steve Stamatiadis over at Krome Studios in Australia and their previous discussions with James 'Ender' Brown, the ScummVM project team is proud to bring you the French talkie version of the game.

You can download it from the [downloads page](/downloads/#extras). Have fun!
