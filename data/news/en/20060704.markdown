As many users of the Windows CE port have noticed, the 0.9.0 release has some sound and music related issues which usually ended with a crash. The obscure bugs were hunted down and corrected. We urge all PocketPC and Smartphone users to download the updated 0.9.0a build from our [downloads page](/downloads/) or our [SourceForge](/frs/scummvm/0.9.0/) files section. It may be a while until all mirrors pick up the file, so be patient.
