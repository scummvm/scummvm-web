While aboard the subway, your train car is sucked into an alternate dimension, a labyrinth that spans the space-time continuum. Its creator, Daedalus, is forced to oversee its construction by the evil King Minos, who wants to use it to invade and conquer all times and places. Daedalus pleads for the player to find a way to destroy the labyrinth before Minos can complete his conquest.
