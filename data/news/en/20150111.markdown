ScummVM takes you on an adventure in the world of Zork, with support for two new games! In Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands, your task is to embark on a journey to solve the mystery of a spirit called Nemesis, and of the four alchemists it killed. On your second journey to Zork, in Zork: Grand Inquisitor, you must find three legendary objects that will restore all magic to the realm and bring about the fall of Grand Inquisitor Yannick, whose goal is to "shun magic, shun the appearance of magic, shun everything, and then shun shunning".

The ScummVM Team is proud to announce that both [*Zork Nemesis: The Forbidden Lands*](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/zork-nemesis-the-forbidden-lands) and [*Zork: Grand Inquisitor*](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/zork-grand-inquisitor) are now playable in ScummVM using the latest [daily builds](/downloads/#daily), and ready for testing. As usual, all bugs should be reported to [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) following our [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs). While you play through the two games, we would also love it if you could take some [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) for us.

So, grab your game discs and help test! If you don't own the games already, they can be purchased online at GOG.com:
