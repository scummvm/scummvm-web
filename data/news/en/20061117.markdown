As you may know, some time ago we adopted the [cinematique evo.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cine/) engine, which was maintained by Yaz0r. The engine is used by two games: *[Future Wars](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Future_Wars)* and *[Operation Stealth](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Operation_Stealth)*. Now, after several months of work, we are pleased to announce support for *Future Wars* in daily SVN builds of ScummVM.

Currently only the DOS version is supported, but in a variety of languages.

We would like to ask you, our fellow users, to perform testing for us. However, it does not mean that the next major release is near, but that we are ready for [bug reports](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). So, grab your copy of the game (if you own it) and test every bit of it. You will need a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM and your protection booklet handy in order to run the game. Then, if a bug, glitch, or even if a console message pops up, please report it. Instructions on reporting bugs can be found [here](/faq/#question.report-bugs).

Also, we need several good looking in-game screenshots. See the [screenshot submission guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).
