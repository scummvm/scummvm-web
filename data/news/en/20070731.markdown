Results are in folks for the 2007 [Community Choice Awards](https://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/) and ScummVM has won in the **Best Project for Gamers** category!

In true award-ceremony spirit, we'd like to thank first and foremost you, our users. Over the years, you've helped us grow as a project, pointed out bugs and contributed code.

Second, we'd like to thank our project hoster, [SourceForge.net](http://www.sourceforge.net). These guys maintain and develop the platform we depend on to collaborate and communicate our code.

Once again, a great big thanks to the community for supporting ScummVM. It really is an honor for us to be picked as a top project within 150.000+ potential contestants.

So if you haven't done so, go forth and download the latest, [Award Winning (TM) ScummVM](/downloads/) version and enjoy some classic adventure games on your favorite platform!
