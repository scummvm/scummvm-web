Grab a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM for testing, and make sure to follow our [guidelines for release testing](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing). **Windows users**, please use a [Kirben daily build](http://scummvm.org/downloads/scummvm-win32.exe) instead of a Buildbot daily build. Report any bugs you encounter to our [bug tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/), and once you’ve finished a playthrough, [fill out our test results form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfiAycQmgaBEDsb0KNpZrNAaqBtilZe4SHWRDYcykeKqLHFvg/viewform). You can [track testing progress on the wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/2.0.0) as it happens.

Happy gaming!
