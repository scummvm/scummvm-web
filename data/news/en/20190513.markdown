Last week Google announced the accepted projects for this year's Summer of Code. We are pleased and excited to say that ScummVM will be mentoring four students this year. All four of them will work on game engines:

*   Andrii Prykhodko (a.k.a. whiterandrek) is back and will be working on adding support for the ***[Red Comrades 1: Save the Galaxy](https://www.mobygames.com/game/red-comrades-save-the-galaxy-reloaded)*** and ***[Red Comrades 2: For the Great Justice](https://www.mobygames.com/game/red-comrades-2)*** games to ScummVM.
*   Nipun Garg will be working on adding support for ***[Hyperspace Delivery Boy!](https://www.mobygames.com/game/hyperspace-delivery-boy)*** game to ScummVM.
*   Jaromír Wysoglad (a.k.a. Jarda) will be working on the second part of the ***[Mission Supernova](http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/mission-supernova/)*** game.
*   Antonio Román Cerezo (a.k.a. Kyranet) will be working on implementing networking in ScummVM for the ***[Moonbase Commander](http://www.mobygames.com/game/moonbase-commander)*** game.

Please welcome with us our four adventurous students for what we hope will be a productive and interesting summer! And as always you can follow their progress throughout the summer on the [ScummVM Blogs](http://planet.scummvm.org).
