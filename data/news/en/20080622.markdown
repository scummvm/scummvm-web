You know there's something wrong when Count Drascula stops watching TV and starts conspiring with his faithful sidekick, Igor, to take over the world. And he wants to do that before tonight's football match starts! You are John Hacker and your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to rescue your girlfriend Billy Jean from Count Drascula's nefarious clutches and thwart his plans of world domination!

You will need your Drascula CD, a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM and [drascula.dat](https://scummvm.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/dists/engine-data/drascula.dat).
