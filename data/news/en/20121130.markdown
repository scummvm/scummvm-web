The city of Waterdeep is in dire need of heroes to defend it from the evil below the city. Assemble a group of four heroes, heed the call of the Lords of Waterdeep and start your quest in the sewers below the city!

But beware, for this is not your only quest. Archmage Khelben needs you to investigate strange happenings near the Temple of Darkmoon. People around it are disappearing and human remains are found in shallow graves.

The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce support for [*Eye of the Beholder*](https://www.mobygames.com/game/eye-of-the-beholder) and [*Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon*](https://www.mobygames.com/game/eye-of-the-beholder-ii-the-legend-of-darkmoon).
