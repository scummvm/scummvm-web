We are not only constantly working on improving ScummVM's compatibility or implementing new games, but sometimes also on improving the project's general appearance.

Over the last couple of months, long-term ScummVM fan and new team member Mataniko worked hard on improving our website design which serves us well since over a decade. We are proud to say that the ScummVM website is now fully responsive and looks absolutely beautiful on your PC and your mobile devices.

If you have any issues with the updated website or the feeling that something is missing, please let us now on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm-web/issues).
