Even if we won SourceForge's [Community Choice Awards 2007](https://sourceforge.net/community/cca07) in the game section, ScummVM is not basking in the shadows of yesterday's triumphs.

New games are continuously being worked on, and compatibility for supported ones is being constantly improved. In short, our team is going to sweat its way through the upcoming summer.

We know you think we deserve to win without a fight, but let's do things by the book. So please, help now with the nomination phase and cast your [vote for 'Best Project for Gamers'](https://sourceforge.net/community/cca08-nominate?group_id=37116) (requires registration at SourceForge).
