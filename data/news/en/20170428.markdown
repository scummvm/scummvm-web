Explore a haunted museum, hunt a serial killer, mop the floor, descend into madness, find your true love, find your “true love”, travel to lands below, solve the Voodoo Murders, rediscover a lost opera—or do it all! The first batch of 32-bit DOS/Windows Sierra adventures are now ready to be tested in the latest [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM:

The [Datafiles page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#All_SCI32_.28SCI2.2F3.29_games) has been updated with instructions on how to install these games. If you don’t own some, go to our [where to get the games](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Where_to_get_the_games#Sierra_Games) page to buy them!

Before you start your test run, please read the instructions on our [SCI testing page](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SCI/Testing), and take some [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) along the way.

(If you have been itching to play some of the earlier SCI games, please take this time to run through them again too, as changes to the engine may also affect some 16-bit SCI games!)

Have fun!
