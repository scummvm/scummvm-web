It seems that work on cleanup and improvements to the Ultima VIII integration was further along than I had anticipated. It's now been confirmed that Ultima VIII is completeable under ScummVM as well, so it joins Ultima IV and Ultima VI for official testing.

So break out your copies of Ultima VIII as well and give it a try! You will need a [daily development build](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html). As always, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
