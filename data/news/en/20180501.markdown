Battle to liberate the populace from the threat of the tyrant Lord Xeen, or his cruel master Alamar. Or dare to venture beyond the world of Xeen to the world of Havoc to test your mettle with a new challenge. We're pleased to announce support for the following games:

*   Might and Magic IV - Clouds of Xeen
*   Might and Magic V - Darkside of Xeen
*   Might and Magic - World of Xeen
*   Might and Magic - World of Xeen 2 CD Talkie
*   Might and Magic - Swords of Xeen

At this time, only the English versions of these games are ready for testing. So break out your copies, or buy them digitally on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/might_and_magic_6_limited_edition?pp=22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d), and grab the latest [daily build](http://scummvm.org/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM. You'll also need an extra required [xeen.ccs](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/dists/engine-data/xeen.ccs?raw=true) file, which should be put in the same folder you copy your game files to.

Before you start testing any of the games, please be aware that given the large part combat plays in the game, any errors you encounter may be more difficult to replicate than in traditional adventure games. As such, it'll be a good idea to make a practice of regularly saving your game, just in case something goes wrong. If you do experience any crashes, or notice any functionality which seems incorrect, please let us know. Any problems found should be reported on our [Issue Tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
