James Woodcock has today released his enhanced music for classic point & click adventure game *Touché: The Adventures of the Fifth Musketeer*, as part of his 'ScummVM Music Enhancement Project'.

By adding the external digital music files provided for free by James and with our ScummVM software, users can enjoy the updated soundtrack within the actual title as it is played.

Using modern MIDI hardware, James edits the original MIDI information and records them as external digital music files. Developers of ScummVM then add code so the newly created files will work within the titles.

"ScummVM has always inspired my involvement and although I am not a programmer, I hope my ScummVM Music Enhancement Project adds a little extra enjoyment to users of this fine point and click adventure software." says James Woodcock, creator of the enhanced soundtrack.

James has previously released other enhanced soundtracks for titles including:

*   *Beneath A Steel Sky*
*   *Discworld*
*   *Inherit the Earth*
*   *Simon the Sorcerer*
*   *The 7th Guest*
