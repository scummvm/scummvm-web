In light of the 0.8.0 release, which requires the additional SKY.CPT file to run Beneath a Steel Sky, we've updated the archive of the freeware CD version to include this file, and while we were at it, updated the data files to the last-known released version of BASS, which should fix some text issues that appear when playing the game in non-english languages.

You can download it from the [downloads page](/downloads/) (whenever the SourceForge mirrors pick it up), or download the SKY.CPT file separately [here](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/raw/master/dists/engine-data/sky.cpt).
