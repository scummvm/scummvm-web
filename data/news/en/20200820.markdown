title: "Blazing Dragons Set ScummVM Aflame"

After many months of development Blazing Dragons is now ready for public testing.

Join young dragon Flicker as he attempts to win the hand of Princess Flame and save Camelhot along the way.

This is a rather odd Point and Click game as it was only released on Consoles.
ScummVM's new Dragons engine allows you to run the Playstation version of this somewhat forgotten title. Throw away that PS1 controller and enjoy the game with a mouse/keyboard interface. We've also taken out all the annoying loading screens.

Only the US and GB Playstation 1 versions are supported at the moment.

You will need a [daily development build](https://buildbot.scummvm.org/builds.html). As always, please submit the bug reports to our [issue tracker](https://bugs.scummvm.org/).
