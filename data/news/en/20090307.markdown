As you open the mailbox behind the white house, a wizard tells you that you're the lucky sweepstakes winner, who can now play several great game titles by Activision under ScummVM!

We welcome the addition of the MADE engine by Activision. Four shiny new games are now supported: The infamous Return to Zork, Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2, The Manhole and Rodney's Funscreen

All you need to have is a copy of one of the aforementioned Activision games, and a new [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM.

If you find any bugs, you're welcome to report them to our [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/). Screenshots are also needed, which you can submit following our [Screenshot submission guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).
