...on a moving ship and you've got no recollections on how you got there. Can you find your way around when you're [*Lost in Time*](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Lost_in_Time)?

Same procedure as last time: Get your copy of *Lost in Time* and a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM, then report all bugs to [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) and submit screenshots to [our patch tracker](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=37116&atid=418822). For further information, check out the [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs) and [screenshot guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots), respectively.

Have fun, and good luck (you'll need it ;P).
