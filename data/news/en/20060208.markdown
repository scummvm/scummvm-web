Due to a bug discovered in 0.8.1, which rendered Broken Sword 2 unplayable, we're forced to release ScummVM 0.8.2 "Broken Broken Sword 2". Also, we used this opportunity to fix the WinCE builds, as well as the MacOS X bundle.

As usual, you can get builds for all supported platforms on our [downloads page](/downloads/)
