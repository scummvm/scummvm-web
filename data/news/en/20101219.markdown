The last ScummVM release in this year just has been released. This is a maintenance release and is aimed to fix several important bugs since 1.2.0.

Particularly we added Hungarian and Brazilian translations of the GUI, and made bugfixes to the Cruise, Groovie and Lure engines.

It is available from our [downloads](/downloads/) page and full release notes could be found [here](/frs/scummvm/1.2.1/ReleaseNotes).
