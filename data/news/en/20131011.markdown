On the 9th of October 2001, the very first commit was made to a CVS repository and thus the ScummVM project was born...

As I write this post, it is now the 11th of October 2013 and we have over 58000 commits in the ScummVM Git repository... but still based on that initial commit over a decade ago!

Thus on the project's 12th anniversary, I believed ScummVM deserved a present... Thus myself, James Woodcock and the ScummVM PR Team present "ScummVM: THE MOVIE"! :)
