Did you ever want to experience the world of the Toons, like in the movies "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" or "Space Jam"? Enter [Toonstruck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonstruck), the zany newly supported game that casts Christopher Lloyd (Great Scott!) as Drew Blanc, a cartoon animator who lands in a place where anything is possible. With his sidekick Flux Wildly, help him to solve the tons of puzzles in order to get back home to the real world!

Take your Bottomless Bag, grab your two Toonstruck CDs, the [latest daily build of ScummVM](/downloads/#daily) and start testing the game right away! You can find the required datafiles [here](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Toonstruck).

Please post any bugs you find in the [bugtracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/), following our [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs). Any [screenshot](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) of your playthrough is welcome.
