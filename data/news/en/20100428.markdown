![GSoC 2010 Logo](/data/news/20100428.jpg) Google recently announced the list of students for this year's [Summer of Code](http://socghop.appspot.com) program.  
  
For ScummVM, the accepted students and their respective projects can be found at our [landing page](http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2010/scummvm) of the GSoC 2010 site.

The ScummVM team and especially the mentors welcome our 4 students this year:  
  
[Neeraj](http://sud03r.wordpress.com/), [Tony](http://tonypuccinelli.blogspot.com/), [Michael](http://blog.birdiesoft.dk/) and [Alejandro](http://vgvgf.com.ar/gsoc/) who will be tackling a [range of interesting projects](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Summer_of_Code/GSoC2010).  
Congratulations, the best of luck and enjoy coding this summer :-)

We would also like to take the time to thank everyone who applied for ScummVM GSoC places this year but was unsuccessful.  
We hope we can welcome many of you into our community.
