Yes, we are still alive. Unfortunatly far from being ready for 0.2.0, several people have raised a large number of critical bugs we are working through. Stick with us, we'll get their eventually!  
  
Oh, and by the way.. if anyone knows the location of Sean Clark or any other person who scripted Sam and Max, please kidnap them and force them to explain an annoying script race in the Mystery Vortex which has kept several of us awake for the last 48 hours.  
  
Thanks, and enjoy ScummVM :)
