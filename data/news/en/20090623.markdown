There are certain speculations about the case, some of them are really wild. Unfortunately, no one approached any of us and there are only a few real facts in those blog posts.

Thus, in an attempt to stop these potentially misleading messages, I made a [blog post](http://sev-notes.blogspot.com/2009/06/gpl-scummvm-and-violations.html) on my personal blog. I hope that I provided enough information there. If not, ask me for more details.
