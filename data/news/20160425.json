We are pleased to say that ScummVM will be mentoring four lucky students who will have to spend their summer in a dark room in front of their screen. We expect this will be an interesting Journey, passing through shadowy gates to visit scary dungeons under dark clouds. All while the mentors will be hunting three-headed monkeys on a tropical island, enjoying the sun, the beach and the grog.</p><ul><li>Borja Lorente Escobar (a.k.a. blorente) will be working on porting the <b><i>MacVenture engine</i></b> to ScummVM.</li><li>Bendegúz Nagy (a.k.a.
