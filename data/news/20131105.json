    "content": "<p>The Wintermute engine has been in the works in ScummVM for a little over a year now, and it has gotten more and more mature, to the point that we feel it is getting close to being ready for release.</p><p>Since the amount of games involved is rather huge, we'd love to get some help with a round of testing before we check off on the engine being ready for our next release. Thus, we have semi-arbitrarily selected a set of Wintermute-games that would benefit from some testing, and hope that some of our wonderful users are willing to take them for a spin.</p><p>If you are interested, head on over to our <a href=\"http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=13062\">WME Testing thread</a>.</p>",
