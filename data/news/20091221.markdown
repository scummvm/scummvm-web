The year is 1995. The place is the Czech Republic. You find yourself surrounded by inventive minds producing the latest Czech point-and-click adventure, and historically the first Czech CD-ROM-based adventure game. You are Bert, a young dragon with a taste for adventure. After being corrupted by an evil magic wand named Eveline, you are desperate to remedy the mischiefs you created. You decide to set out to find your father who disappeared a while ago.

Grab your copy of the [Dragon History game](http://www.ucw.cz/draci-historie/index-en.html) and a [Subversion build of ScummVM](/downloads/#daily), and get playing! The game is available in Czech, English, and Polish so you have no excuses!
