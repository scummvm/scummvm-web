Get your season (of docs) pass ready! We are excited to announce that ScummVM has been accepted as a participant of [Google Season of Docs 2020](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs). One of the most important parts of every open source project is its documentation. Good documentation is vital for making the project accessible to both end users and new developers wanting to have a deeper look into the project's internals so they can start contributing on their own.

Season of Docs, a recent initiative by Google to connect technical writers with open source projects. The program offers a great way to gain practical project experience, as well as explore the world of free software and the great communities that evolve around them. 

For ScummVM this is a wonderful opportunity to improve our documentation. You can check out our [ideas page](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Season_of_Docs/GSoD_Ideas) or if you want to bring up your own ideas - get in touch with us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BrAxEQ).

We've had a lot of successful student projects as part of Google's Summer of Code in previous years - we’re looking forward to carrying that success into Google's Season of Docs and inspire you to work with us and add your very own success.

The deadline for proposals is July 9. Please make sure to read the program timeline, guidelines and FAQ on [the Season of Docs website](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs)  for additional information.
