In addition to the two new games for this release, <i>Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos</i> and <i>Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</i>, we have a few other games that need testing. Please take a look at <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.4.0\">our wiki page</a> to see which games need a playthrough.</p><p>As with all release testing, you'll need a <a href=\"/downloads/#daily\">daily build</a> to get started. If you happen to find any bugs, please report them on the <a href=\"http://bugs.scummvm.org/\">bug tracker</a>. Once you complete one of the games, please let us know on <a href=\"http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=10901\">the forums</a> so we can throw the results up on the <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing/1.4.0\">wiki page</a>. Further information can be found in the <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing\">release testing guidelines</a>.</p><p>And Strangerke would like to remind you to grab a couple of screenshots of <i>Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos</i> and <i>Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</i> for us and submit them according to our <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots\">guidelines</a>.</p>",
