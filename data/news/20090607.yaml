[![Find out about EL/LAK](/data/news/20090607.png)](http://conf.ellak.gr) The 3rd free/open source software developers [conference](http://conf.ellak.gr) ([EL/LAK](http://www.ellak.gr)) is taking place in Athens, Greece on June 19 and 20. Among the various open source software and related talks, this year ScummVM will also be participating with a presentation on June 20th.

The presentation intially aims to cover basic principles on how ScummVM works, its internal architecture and developer team layout. But we can also talk about adventure games in general, Google Summer of Code, open source gaming subjects or what ever else comes up!

So if you're around and interested, go forth and [register](http://www.ellak.gr/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=registers) for the conference and come by for a meet & greet. See you there!
