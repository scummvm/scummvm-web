Well, you can read the online article intended to compliment the segment on the <a href=\"http://www.techtv.com/callforhelp/freefile/story/0,24330,3640615,00.html\">TechTV Website</a>.</p><p>ScummVM will be shown as 'Free File of the Day' on the 'Call for Help' program at 3PM EST on Friday the 19th of March, and again at 9AM Eastern on Monday the 22nd of March.</p><p>Don't know how to watch TechTV? I'm told those of you in America can tune into DirecTV channel 354, Dish Network channel #191, or locate the cable channel by following the instructions on <a href=\"http://tv.yahoo.com/grid?\">tv.yahoo</a></p><p>Or, if you just happen to have a C-band dish in the general vicinity of GE Americom Satcom C4 at the time of the show, it's on transponder 12 at 135 degrees west, 40 degrees elevation.</p><p>Those lucky Australians subscribed to Foxtel Digital can also watch the program. I have to try and find somebody with FTD so I can watch it myself.</p>",
