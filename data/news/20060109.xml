At long last, <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#CVS">ScummVM CVS</a> now has basic support
for The Legend of Kyrandia by Westwood Studios. The game is fully completable, but lacks music,
sound effects and a menu system (for now). Please refer to section 3.8 of the
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scummvm/scummvm/feaa67ca166d4808dcc9d6393b3673ceca25d6cb/README">README</a> for more 
information, and to the <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#extras">Downloads</a> section for the
necessary datafile. All bugs should be reported to our <a href="http://bugs.scummvm.org/">
bug tracker</a>, please see section 4.10 of the <a href="http://scummvm.org/faq.php#question.report-bugs">FAQ</a> for
instructions.
