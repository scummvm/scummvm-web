    "content": "<p>Observant users have noticed that there is an updated version of Flight of the Amazon Queen on SourceForge but not, until now, on the ScummVM <a href=\"/downloads/\">downloads page</a>.</p><p>Apart from some minor typographical changes to the license to keep the legal beagles happy, the only difference compared to the old version is that it has been compressed using the latest version of the ScummVM tools. This should fix problems with clicks at the beginning of some speech, and speech being played a bit too slow. (ScummVM 0.12.0 already has a workaround for the latter problem, so you may not even notice the difference.)</p>",
