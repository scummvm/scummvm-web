After tireless weeks of work, the ScummVM team is proud to announce support for two children's adventure games — <i>Gregory and the Hot Air Balloon</i> and <i>Darby the Dragon</i> — And on top of that, you can also play some interactive books from the <i>Magic Tales</i> series. So, if you can find your childhood spirit, dig out your copies and enjoy those adorable games.</p><p>To play these, you'll need a <a href=\"/downloads/#daily\">daily build</a> of ScummVM. Any lurking bugs you find should be reported using our <a href=\"http://bugs.scummvm.org/\">bug tracker</a>, and along the way, please consider making few screenshots, following our <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots\">guidelines</a>.</p><p>We are also looking for additional information on localised versions and <i>Magic Tales</i> books. If you have one which is not recognized by the latest ScummVM daily build, please follow the guidelines <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Reporting_unknown_MD5_checksums\">here</a> and report this to the team or as a bug.</p><p>Have fun!</p>",
