    "content": "<p>It has been over 10 years. We are here thanks to the work of 131 developers. 49,124 commits were made just to the ScummVM tree and those turned into a massive 1,085,714 lines of code (excluding comments) and of course over 7.6 million downloads from the main site alone. I would say those were a great ten years.</p><p>The outcome is ScummVM 1.4.0 which we are releasing today, 11/11/11 11:11:11.11.</p><p>More games are supported: <i>Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos</i><small>(based on the same engine as Kyrandia)</small>, the kids' game <i>Blue's Birthday Adventure</i>, and the science fiction game <i>Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch</i>. On top of that, practically all supported Sierra SCI games now have their Amiga versions working.
