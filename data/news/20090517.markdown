Since ScummVM 0.10.0 there has been unannounced support for subtitles in the *Broken Sword 1* cutscenes.

Now we finally managed to provide a package with subtitles for the following languages: English, Brazilian, German, Spanish, French, Italian and Russian. Also, subtitles for the English demo are provided.

You can grab the package from the [downloads](/downloads/#extras) page.

At the moment we still lack Czech subtitles, thus if you're willing to help us with providing them, please contact sev.
