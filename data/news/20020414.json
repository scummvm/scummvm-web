    "content": "The 0.2.0 release has been put off for a while as the ScummVM engine is again undergoing some reorganisation. However, as an intresting bit of trivia, the 0.2.0 release will also include support for a non-SCUMM game! Simon The Sorcerer. So share and enjoy the latest CVS folks. <BR><BR> Also some of you may have noticed a PayPal button at the bottom of the navigation bar. If you've enjoyed ScummVM please donate some money to help us buy software to help development. Thanks!"
