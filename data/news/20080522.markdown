Still the same old procedure: Get your copy of *The Bizarre Adventures of Woodruff and the Schnibble* and a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM. Report all bugs to [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) and submit screenshots you've made along the way to [our patch tracker](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=37116&atid=418822), following the [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs) and [screenshot guidelines](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots).
