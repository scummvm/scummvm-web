    "content": "<p>Perhaps you haven't noticed, but now ScummVM's website runs new flashy code. Fredrik Wendel aka [vEX] has been working on it for several months now, and under the hood it is a complete rewrite with keeping the old design intact... Well, almost.</p><p>Now browsing screenshots has a new sleek design, navigation links are more logical (with keeping the backwards compatibility, so don't worry about your old links), SCUMM MD5 tables have better design, and the FAQ lost its magic numbers in the links.</p><p>Also we are proud to announce that Fredrik has been appointed official webmaster for the project, so now you can put all your complaints into his capable hands. :P</p>",
