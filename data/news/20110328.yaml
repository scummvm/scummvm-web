We're pleased to announce that the next release of ScummVM will have support for several ["Living Books"](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Mohawk/Games#Living_Books_Series) games! It's time to relive your childhood memories (or memories of your children!) and dust off the old discs. The (sadly) now grown-up ScummVM team no longer has all of these games lying around, so we need *your* help in testing the games to weed out any remaining bugs.

The first batch of supported Living Books games consists of *Just Grandma and Me* (v1), *Arthur's Teacher Trouble*, *Aesop's Fables: The Tortoise and the Hare*, *Ruff's Bone*, *The New Kid on the Block*, *Arthur's Birthday* (v1), *Little Monster at School*, *Harry and the Haunted House*, *The Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight*, *Dr. Seuss's ABC*, *Sheila Rae, the Brave*, *The Berenstain Bears in the Dark*, *Stellaluna*, and most of *Green Eggs and Ham*. We hope to support the rest of the games in the future, but in the meantime, we hope that these are enough to keep our loyal users occupied.

Be sure to grab a [daily build](/downloads/#daily) when testing. If you spot any bugs while enjoying these classic interactive stories or even just complete one, we'd really like to know over on [the forums](http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=10097). Be sure to drink your ovaltine post them to the [bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/); and keep those [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs) in mind. And if anyone happens to take a few [screenshots](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots) before nap time and wishes to submit them, we would be eternally grateful.
