    "content": "<p>...and the finger points to you! Or to be precise to Zanthia, youngest of the Kyrandian Mystics. But since she is the one you play in ScummVM's newest supported adventure <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/The_Legend_of_Kyrandia:_Book_Two:_Hand_of_Fate\"><i>The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Two: Hand of Fate</i></a> that is not a big difference. So grab your copy of <i>The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Two: Hand of Fate</i> and a <a href=\"/downloads/#daily\">daily build</a> of ScummVM to help her save Kyrandia.</p><p>Since we are not finished with supporting every feature, there are still some missing: Currently we support only the DOS CD-ROM version. Another thing missing is support for the in-game GUI, so saving is possible only via hotkeys. Check out the hotkey section of our <a href=\"http://scummvm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/README?view=markup\">README</a> on how to do it. And last but not least we do not support MIDI output, so make sure you use AdLib as \"Music Driver\".</p><p>Of course all bugs should be reported to <a href=\"http://bugs.scummvm.org/\">our bug tracker</a>. Make sure you got all required <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Legend_of_Kyrandia.2C_The:_Hand_of_Fate\">datafiles</a> before you report a bug though. For further information, check out the <a href=\"/faq/#question.report-bugs\">bug submission guidelines</a>.</p>",
