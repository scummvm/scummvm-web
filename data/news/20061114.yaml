As some of you may have noticed, the Mac OS X version of ScummVM 0.9.1 had some issues when running on PowerPC machines, particularly when playing MP3 encoded sound. A new build (0.9.1a) is now up on the [downloads page](/downloads/), for anyone affected (All versions beyond the Mac OS X version remain the same).
