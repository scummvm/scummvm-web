It's time to relive your childhood memories (or memories of your children!) and dust off the old discs. The (sadly) now grown-up ScummVM team no longer has all of these games lying around, so we need <i>your</i> help in testing the games to weed out any remaining bugs.</p><p>The first batch of supported Living Books games consists of <i>Just Grandma and Me</i> (v1), <i>Arthur's Teacher Trouble</i>, <i>Aesop's Fables: The Tortoise and the Hare</i>, <i>Ruff's Bone</i>, <i>The New Kid on the Block</i>, <i>Arthur's Birthday</i> (v1), <i>Little Monster at School</i>, <i>Harry and the Haunted House</i>, <i>The Berenstain Bears Get in a Fight</i>, <i>Dr. Seuss's ABC</i>, <i>Sheila Rae, the Brave</i>, <i>The Berenstain Bears in the Dark</i>, <i>Stellaluna</i>, and most of <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>. We hope to support the rest of the games in the future, but in the meantime, we hope that these are enough to keep our loyal users occupied.</p><p>Be sure to grab a <a href=\"/downloads/#daily\">daily build</a> when testing. If you spot any bugs while enjoying these classic interactive stories or even just complete one, we'd really like to know over on <a href=\"http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=10097\">the forums</a>. Be sure to <del>drink your ovaltine</del> post them to the <a href=\"http://bugs.scummvm.org/\">bug tracker</a>; and keep those <a href=\"/faq/#question.report-bugs\">bug submission guidelines</a> in mind. And if anyone happens to take a few <a href=\"http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots\">screenshots</a> before nap time and wishes to submit them, we would be eternally grateful.</p>",
