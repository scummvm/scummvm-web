"Animal sales was a profitable and prestigious business, since most real animals had died out after the Terran War; there were plenty of electric ones, though—" Oh, ahem, didn’t notice you there.

ScummVM Team is thrilled to announce the release of ScummVM version 2.1.0. This release is the culmination of nearly two years worth of work, adding 16 new games based on 8 engines, a Nintendo Switch port and nearly 500 bug fixes. All this done by the hard work of 147 contributors across 8,493 commits.

The newly supported games are:

*   *Blade Runner*
*   *Duckman: The Graphic Adventures of a Private Dick*
*   *Hoyle Bridge*
*   *Hoyle Children's Collection*
*   *Hoyle Classic Games*
*   *Hoyle Solitaire*
*   *Hyperspace Delivery Boy!*
*   *Might and Magic IV - Clouds of Xeen*
*   *Might and Magic V - Darkside of Xeen*
*   *Might and Magic - World of Xeen*
*   *Might and Magic - Swords of Xeen*
*   *Mission Supernova Part 1*
*   *Mission Supernova Part 2*
*   *Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness*
*   *The Prince and the Coward*
*   *Versailles 1685*

In addition, we enhanced the Android and iOS ports considerably. You will also notice the new GUI facelift, improved Roland MT-32 sound emulation, a new pixel-perfect stretching mode, Text-to-Speech support on macOS and Linux, and last but not least, support for synchronizing saves and downloading game data from cloud-based file services (see the up-to-date list of the platforms in [our user manual](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=User_Manual/Using_Cloud_and_LAN_features))

As usual, we have improved many of the existing engines: added support for the *25th Myst Anniversary* releases, fixed more than 100 original SCI script bugs that have plagued Sierra games for decades, added support for Amiga and FM-TOWNS versions of *Eye of the Beholder*, improved audio quality in Humongous Entertainment games and added lip sync to the newer LucasArts adventure titles, squashed tons of bugs in *Starship Titanic* and *Bud Tucker*. The list goes on and on, and you may see the comprehensive change log [here](https://www.scummvm.org/frs/scummvm/2.1.0/ReleaseNotes.html).

Have no more tears in rain and [grab](/downloads/) this electric release. Windows and macOS users may get the auto-update when starting ScummVM.
