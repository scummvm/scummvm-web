After the previous announcement, several of you asked for the Italian version of Flight of the Amazon Queen. We would like to thank Hkz for providing the original CD and John Passfield and Steve Stamatiadis for accepting our request to make this version freeware. The ScummVM project team is therefore proud to bring you the Italian version of the game, using English speech with Italian subtitles.

You can download it from the [downloads page](/downloads/#extras). Have fun!
