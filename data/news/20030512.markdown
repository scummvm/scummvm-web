Five months after our last release, 0.3.0b, and over 2500 CVS commits/adds later, the ScummVM team proudly presents ScummVM 0.4.0.

The following is an overview of what's new in 0.4.0:

*   Curse of Monkey Island (comi) support (experimental)
*   Added support for the EGA versions of Loom, Monkey Island and Indy3
*   Improved music support in Indy3 and the floppy versions of Monkey Island
*   Many Simon the Sorcerer 1 & 2 improvements and fixes
*   Very pre-alpha Beneath a Steel Sky code. Don't expect it to do anything (in fact it is disabled in the 0.4.0 release, but you can get it by compiling ScummVM yourself).
*   Even more pre-alpha support for enhanced versions of V2 SCUMM games (Maniac Mansion and Zak)
*   Preliminary support for early Humongous Entertainment titles (very experimental)
*   New debug console and several GUI/Launcher enhancements
*   New Save/Load code (easier to expand while retaining compatibility)
*   Dreamcast port now works with new games added for 0.3.0b
*   New official PalmOS port
*   Various minor and not so minor SCUMM game fixes
*   Large memory leak fixed for The Dig/COMI
*   SMUSH code optimised, frame dropping added for slower machines
*   Code cleanups

The source code, as well as binaries for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, PocketPC, Solaris and PalmOS are already available at our [download page](/downloads/). Other binaries for MorphOS, Dreamcast and others, will follow shortly.

*We hope you will enjoy the best ScummVM ever!*
