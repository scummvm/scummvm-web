It's the year 2318; you're part of an agency created to protect the integrity of the timeline after time travel has been invented. After it is detected that someone has changed the past, it's up to you to repair the time stream!

The ScummVM Team is proud to announce support for the Macintosh version of *The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime*. So go grab the [latest daily build](/downloads/#daily) of ScummVM and play through the game to assist us in testing!

If you find any bugs while playing, please report them to [our bug tracker](http://bugs.scummvm.org/) following our [bug submission guidelines](/faq/#question.report-bugs). For information on how to extract the data off the disc, follow instructions listed [on our wiki](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Extract_Pegasus_Prime).
