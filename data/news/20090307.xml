<p>As you open the mailbox behind the white house, a wizard tells you that you're the lucky
 sweepstakes winner, who can now play several great game titles by Activision under ScummVM!</p>

<p>We welcome the addition of the MADE engine by Activision. Four shiny new games are now
 supported: The infamous Return to Zork, Leather Goddesses of Phobos 2, The Manhole and Rodney's
 Funscreen</p>

<p>All you need to have is a copy of one of the aforementioned Activision games, and a new
