Many thanks to Laura Abbott who spent a lot of time to compose this list and then generously donated it to us. I am sure this will help us working on FOA issues in the future.</p><p>In other news, Robert Kelsen has volunteered to work as a SlackWare packager, and has started by providing a <a href=\"/frs/scummvm/0.7.0/scummvm-0.7.0-slack-i486-1.tgz\">SlackWare binary of 0.7.0</a>. Way to go, Rob!</p><p>So, apparently, some people actually read our news section... I am astonished ;-). Thanks to all of you out there who contribute to ScummVM by providing us with useful feedback, and the occasional praise -- both really help keeping up interest in working on ScummVM!</p>",
