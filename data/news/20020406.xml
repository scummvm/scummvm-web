        After some work, the 256 color CD Talkie version of Loom is completable!
        With this done, we are starting to gear up for a 0.2.0 release. To help
        us with this, we ask you - our game players - to take the latest Daily
        Builds and CVS snapshots and play through your favorite games!<BR>
        
        We need to make sure that the following games are completable with no
        major playability bugs (eg, crashes, freezes, etc - minor issues such
        as sound syncro do not count):
        <UL>
         <LI> Loom CD
         <LI> Monkey Island 1 (CD)
         <LI> Monkey Island 2
         <LI> Indy 4: Fate of atlantis
         <LI> Sam and Max
         <LI> Day of the Tentacle
        </UL>
        Thanks a lot, and we hope everything will work just fine so we can
        finally get a new release out the door! Also, by popular demand,
        0.2.0 will include a new 'auto-save' feature to ensure you'll never
        lose hours of hard work because you forgot to save and suddenly
        found a bug!
