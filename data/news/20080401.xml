		...and the finger points to you! Or to be precise to Zanthia, youngest of the Kyrandian Mystics. But since she is the one you play in ScummVM's newest supported adventure <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/The_Legend_of_Kyrandia:_Book_Two:_Hand_of_Fate">
		<i>The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Two: Hand of Fate</i></a> that is not a big difference. So grab your copy of <i>The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Two: Hand of Fate</i> and a <a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads.php#daily">daily build</a> of ScummVM to help her save Kyrandia.

		Since we are not finished with supporting every feature, there are still some missing:
		Currently we support only the DOS CD-ROM version. Another thing missing is support for the in-game GUI, so saving is possible only via hotkeys. Check out the hotkey section of our <a href="http://scummvm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/scummvm/scummvm/trunk/README?view=markup">README</a> on how to do it.
		And last but not least we do not support MIDI output, so make sure you use AdLib as "Music Driver".
	</p>

		Of course all bugs should be reported to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=418820&amp;group_id=37116&amp;func=browse">our bug tracker</a>.
		Make sure you got all required <a href="http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Datafiles#Legend_of_Kyrandia.2C_The:_Hand_of_Fate">datafiles</a> before you report a bug though.
