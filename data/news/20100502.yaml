Only four weeks since our last release and already ScummVM 1.1.1 is available on our [downloads page](/downloads/).

This release concentrates primarily on fixing bugs, bugs, and even more bugs. As such, we strongly recommend all and every ScummVM user to update to this latest and greatest version. In particular, just as promised we fixed the issues affecting *Nippon Safes Inc* and *Pajama Sam 1* in 1.1.0.

Take a look at the [release notes](/frs/scummvm/1.1.1/ReleaseNotes) if you want to know a bit more.

And don't forget to visit our [downloads page](/downloads/) to get the best ScummVM ever!
