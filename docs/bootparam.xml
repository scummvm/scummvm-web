<NAME>boot params</NAME>
<DESC>A partial list of the boot params of some games.</DESC>
<BODY>
<h2>What are boot params?</h2>
<p>
A boot param is a special number which allows you (if used appropriately, see below)
to go directly to a specific part of a game. These boot params are mostly useful
for debugging and playtesting a game; you get teleported to a certain situation
in a game, with some of the items appropriate for it. It is not always possible to
continue and complete a game from this, because you may lack important items. But
for us developers, it's very helpful, because we can quickly get to trouble spots
in a clean state, and try to reproduce any bugs you report to us.
</p>
<p>
These boot params do not exist by chance or magic: they were put into the game data
by the original developers of the games, and were meant for exactly the same
purpose we use them for: to help in debugging the game. Of course, they also make
a nice cheat system (with some caveats, as I tried to outline above).
</p>


<h2>How do I use a boot param?</h2>
That's quite simple: pick a game from the list, and a boot param for it. Then, specify
it on the command line like this:
<pre>
	./scummvm -d0 -b BOOTPARAM TARGET
</pre>
To be a bit more specific: Let's say you want to get into the hut of the cannibals in 
Monkey Island 1. Well, the table below tells us that this is boot param 5555. So, enter
this on the command line:
<pre>
	./scummvm -d0 -b 5555 monkey
</pre>
(By the way, this would also work with <code>monkey</code>, <code>monkeyvga</code> etc.).


<h2>How did we generate these tables?</h2>

<p>Some of these lists are based on the output of <code>./scummvm -d1 -b1 TARGET</code>; some information is also from
   <a href="http://www.scummbar.com/resources/articles/index.php?newssniffer=readarticle&amp;article=1027">this article</a>.
   These may contain some mistakes. 
   Ultimately we plan to correct these and maybe enhance the descriptions a bit...</p>

<h2>I see a lot of question marks in some of the tables, why?</h2>
<p>
Some of the games contain descriptions for the boot params; some don't. In the latter case,
we have to manually fill in the descriptions. This hasn't been done in all cases yet, as you can see.
</p>
<p>
Help here is welcome -- if you want, feel free to fill in some of the gaps and
<a href="contact.php">send us</a> your work, we'll be happy to integrate it here.

<h2>The Secret of Monkey Island</h2>

<p>Some of the boot params listed in the following table only work in the CD/Mac version
of Monkey Island (and not in 'monkeyega' and 'monkeyvga'). Those are marked with an
asteriks (*) symbol (except for the cases we overlooked ;-).</p>

<p>In addition to the boot params listed below, you can use values greater than 900
to be teleported to specific rooms. To be precise, if you give the number x, then you get
sent to room (x-700).
</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the CD/Mac versions of Monkey (target 'monkey', not 'monkeyvga' or 'monkeyega),
you can specify a boot param between 3000 and 3777 (including both numbers). It's
currently not documented what those boot params do precisely.</p>

<p>
Finally, boot params not covered by the list below will be interpreted as raw room numbers
and cause the game to start in that room.

<h2>Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror</h2>

<p>Broken Sword 2 handles boot params slightly differently. The startup.inf
file contains a list of script resources. For each of these, the game will run
script 0 (each script resource can contain several scripts) to give it an
opportunity to register any number of starting points. Each starting point is
then identified by both its resource and its script number. The descriptions
are also provided by the game, but are of course purely decorative.</p>

<p>Currently, ScummVM assumes that when a boot param is specified on the
command-line, it should use script 1. As can be seen from the table below
that's not always the case. However, you can still access the other start
points from the in-game debug console by using the "start" and "starts"
commands.</p>

<p>Boot params 19 and 949, with script 1, are what's used to start the demo and
full game respectively.</p>

<h2>Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb</h2>

<p>Originally Inherit the Earth didn't have any bootparams, but each scene in
it has pre-script which does all necessary preparations. In ScummVM bootparam jumps
to specified scene and adds Magic Hat item, which lets either jump to any other
scene by using it or gives all important items when you open it.</p>
