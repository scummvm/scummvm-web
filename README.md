# ScummVM-Web

This project is the main ScummVM website located at: https://www.scummvm.org

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes
on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The ScummVM website relies on several tools to install properly.
Before installing please make sure you have the following installed:

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
  * PHP YAML extension. Install via `pecl install yaml` or `sudo apt install php-yaml`
  * The version of PHP included with macOS doesn't include PECL, so you'll need to install a different version of PHP [through Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/php) or another method
  * Alternatively on macOS you can use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) to install both PHP and yaml (for example to use PHP 8.2 `sudo port install php82 php82-yaml php82-iconv php82-intl php82-mbstring php82-sqlite ; sudo port select --set php php82`)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Python & pip](https://www.python.org/) (2.7.9+/3.4+)
* [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Glue](https://glue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
* [Redis](https://redis.io/) (Optional)

### Installing & Developing

Clone this repo

    git clone https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm-web.git

To run the a development version of the site and start a local web server on port 8000, run:

    composer develop

To build for production simply run:

    composer build

## Deployment

To deploy changes to the official ScummVM website, simply go to the website admin page and click the "ScummVM.org
manual site update" link.

## Updating data

Most data is now managed upstream in a spreadsheet. To re-generate the data files
run `composer update-data` note that this will run automatically on site update
but is encouraged for you to do manually to keep track on who's updating the
data.

## Disabling cache

During development, you can disable data caching by creating a file called
`.no-cache` in the root folder.
