		SCUMM stands for "Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion". It is a
		utility used to create the famous LucasArts adventure games.
		</p><p>
		It was initially created in 1987 by Aric Wilmunder and Ron Gilbert for
		the game "Maniac Mansion" and was used later, with some modifications,
		for Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders. Development on the SCUMM
		system continued for some time, and was used in Loom, Indiana Jones and
		the Last Crusade, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Monkey Island
		1,2,3, Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road, Day of the Tentacle, The Dig and Full
		Throttle.

		Yes. As well as SCUMM titles, ScummVM supports Simon the Sorcerer (1 and 2),
		Flight of the Amazon Queen, and the Revolution Games: Broken Sword 1, Broken Sword 
		2, and Beneath a Steel Sky, as well as Gobliiins 1 and Inherit the Earth.

		The short answer: never. The long answer:
		This game is a fan-made replica of the original Maniac Mansion. It is not the same
		game as Maniac Mansion Enhanced, which we do support. It features improved
		music, sound, 256-colors graphics and reworked game interface. It was made using
		the <a href="http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/" target="_top">Adventure Game Studio</a> which
		is a free, albeit closed-source graphics adventures engine. There are Windows,
		Linux and FreeBSD versions of the engine. Its author keeps his source code closed
		due to reasons explained in the project <a href="http://www.bigbluecup.com/acfaq.htm" target="_top">FAQ</a>
		(see last two questions). That means that you need to download that program to
		play the game.

		Again and again people suggest this. The argument usually involves the observation that the
		two projects have similar goals, and that FreeSCI's development is appears to be quite slow
		while ScummVM's seems to be very fast. So, people conclude, that a merge would somehow miraculously
		solve all perceived problems (i.e. increase development speed, increase portability, fix bugs,
		enhance support for newer SCI games, whatever).
		</p><p>
		This logic is flawed in several ways. For example, a merge would not automatically ensure
		SCI support on all platforms ScummVM supports right now; porters would still have to adapt it
		for each platform. It is however true that this would probably be easier than adding support
		for all these platforms to FreeSCI itself. Still, it's far from being easy or simple.
		</p><p>
		Next, it is not true that the development speed would automatically increase. If you look
		at the internal organization of ScummVM, not all our devs actually work on all engines. Typically,
		between one and five people work on a given engine. When new engines are added, only a very
		few people (typically those who performed the merge) actually work on it. That means that in
		order to support (Free)SCI, we first would have to find people who performed that merge,
		and who then secondly would continue to work on the added code. One might wonder whether
		anybody who is capable of such a task and interested in it could not do the very same directly
		within the framework of the FreeSCI project itself, but saving the hassle of first porting
		the code to ScummVM... ? So where is the advantage here, exactly? The only potential
		advantage in this regard would be the hope that other ScummVM devs might develop an interest
		in the SCI code base and started to work on it. Not a completely invalid hope, but there is
		a steep and long road from some trivial bug fixes to actual improvements to the SCI engine.
		Not to forget that those people who know most about how SCI games (its creators aside)
		already work on FreeSCI anyway... :-).
		</p><p>
		We are not fundamentally opposed to merging FreeSCI, but the plain truth is: 
		There is not as much to be gained from this as you might naively believe. Nor is it easy to
		do. There are many more details we could list here, but in the meantime, just have a look
		at <a href="http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?t=1979" target="_top">this thread on our forums</a>
		for a thorough discussion of the subject.

		No. If all the game does is to play or loop a tune it would be possible, but many of the games do
		fancy stuff like smooth transitions from one tune to another, or turn individual instruments on and
		off, etc. There's simply no way ScummVM could take a piece of digital music and emulate that kind
		of behavior.
		</p><p>
		This question usually comes up in connection with Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road (which has a few
		unused bonus audio tracks on the CD) and Monkey Island 2 (which is sometimes distributed on
		the same CD as the version of Monkey Island 1 that uses CD audio). Both of these games do far
		too much fancy stuff to even consider an idea like this.

		First, if you use a ScummVM version prior to 0.7.0 we strongly recommend you
		to upgrade to the latest version, as we improved support for mac games considerably starting with 0.7.0.
		</p><p>
		For newer games ScummVM needs the main data file, usually called
		"&lt;Game Title&gt; Data" (where &lt;Game Title&gt; is
		name of your game, such as "The Dig" or "Sam &amp; Max").
		Some CDs may appear to only contain an application (watch out, it has
		almost the same name as the data file, except that it lacks the " Data"
		at the end). In that case there is still a separate data file but it is
